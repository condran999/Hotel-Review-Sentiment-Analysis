Right from the moment we entered the hotel, the staff made sure that the occasion is getting well celebrated. The reception team sent an amazing cake with a beautiful birthday card in the room. Later in the club, we had so much fun, there were drinks and food, everything was top notch. The entire hotel and club team is very friendly and efficient. Special appreciation to Zaki and Carolyn from the front reception team, they made sure that our overall stay is comfortable. Also want to appreciate Ashish and his team from the club as they made that evening memorable for us. Also want to appreciate Agnel and the staff from fifty five east restaurant, they made a lovely dish for my sister to make her birthday even more‚Ä¶"

The room was wonderful and comfortable. And yes I used my phone as a digital key as well for a change. The room service though pricier than I would have liked was tasty. The room service was kind to assist with toiletries that I had missed as well the following morning. Breakfast was a breeze. A most wonderful team that ensured comfort. A big shot out to Chef Nishad and his lovely team of Jupa, Sandip, Karsh, Mohan, Kilen sumit, harsh, selvam, eric and benaz of the fnb that helped with a lavish breakfast spread.

Hospitality is great, however, a little politeness on the part of the hotel staff could add a notch to it.

He's got an amazing sense of the perfect workout that one would require as per his/her needs. I'd definitely would like to vouch for him. :)"

The welcome goodies from the hotel upon arrival were a good touch.   the evening cocktails are an absolute must and great value for the spread they put out. The spa deserves a. Special compliment as it was extremely hygienic and well  priced for the standard and quality it had to offer.

Our diabetic Mom asked if there was any sugarless dessert in the buffet. Renuka spoke to one of the chefs and he specially made ""sugarless"" bitter chocolate mousse which was amazing! We were touched by their act of going the extra mile."

Like they say a Hotel with its branding and decor can itself be good, but its the STAFF running the show that makes it worthwhile.  Despite shortage of staff the stay was very comfortable, thanks to the people there who went out of their way to make it so.  From In room dining to the laundry , even security guards & everything around was taken care of professionally with a smile.   I would particularly like to thank Ms Manju Shree & Ms. Vijaya from in room dining department for taking out the time to brief me about the meals available and also suggesting good varieties.

Do go through the entire review before you choose this hotel for your special occassions,"We had done the reservation for my friend's birthday celebration through Rutuja Thaker a month back, however right from check-in to check-out it was a nightmare. The hotel firstly is unable to handle the high occupancy in this corona times and not sure if they are low on staff then why to take such high occupancies just to dissapoint the guests. All are requirements were mentioned on the email however none of them were met, neither did we get good view from the room, nor did we get it on higher floor, no cradle in the room even after requesting in the email also the breakfast and dinner buffets were so pathetic that none of the dishes complimented each other. We had a one year old child with us even after mentioning for a cradle in my email we had to wait for more than an hour‚Ä¶"

Let's begin with the Booking- we booked it online through Agoda as it was offering a very good deal (Club executive rooms with Lounge access and one major meal with Breakfast).  1.

164,Bhardwajji,5,Beautiful Property ONLY Because of Wonderful people,"I am usually a long stayer in this Hotel. And every time I come out with an even better experience than before. I would attribute it strongly to the great Management. Because I see all of them without any exception, so sincere and dedicated to their jobs.  Aniket Jadhav stands out when it comes to resolving any issues with House Keeping. He's ever smiling and has solutions and not excuses to any problem faced by the guest. Mr. Percy Lewis and his team from Security are extremely alert. But while they do their job to near perfection, Mr Percy has interests of the guest at heart and makes the guest feel as winner, though actually he's the winner. Mr. Rohan from Room Service, inspite of being extremely busy, knows how to win heart of the guest with his charming way of conversing‚Ä¶"

Overall, the room service staff, front office, kitchen and FOH staff were pleasant, welcoming and caring. There were two areas of concern according to me - The service was slow at times, maybe as the hotel was virtually full. Secondly, I had an unpleasant experience at The Bar.

Being an entrepreneur and a life and business coach, I travel very frequently, yes, even during covid-19 times and I have experienced the best hospitality across all hierarchy of staff in GRAND HYATT, MUMBAI. I have experienced great hospitality in all other five star hotels across Mumbai but hospitality with high efficiency and balance from top to bottom is rare.   It is experiential. The staff took extra care to provide the kind of room I wanted and needless to say they exceeded my expectations.   The breakfast was A M A Z I N G!!!

387,Vanesh,5,Great visit and they made my Mum's birthday special,"We stayed at the Hyatt for my mothers birthday.  With a year in lockdown, we thought we would like a safe place to celebrate and finally get out of the house.  We arrived early but the check in staff were great and were able to give us one of the rooms we booked immediately.  The second room was available at 4pm which was the normal check in time.  The staff has a chocolate cake sent up to the room.   Breakfast was great with an awesome spread of western and indian dishes.  The staff were able to get the food for us from the buffet so as not to have too many guests close to each other.  All in all a memorable stay."

390,Makarand Bhave,1,No more five star service,After all the welcome emails and messages before arrival...I am waiting for my room 2 hour after the regular check-in time....it's frustrating. I gave them a second change after a noisy room last time....will have to look for a different place next time.
391,Keshav biyani,5,Fantastic Sunday lunch experience at Celini,"Had a lovely experience dining at Celini  along with my family. Celini was celebrating St Patrick‚Äôs Weekend and the vibe, experience they created during this lunch was a very unique experience.  Even though the restaurant was full, the service standards were phenomenal. Quentin our server was fantastic taking care of every single need of ours and Dipak as well took fantastic care of us. The food too was fantastic and there were some new unique dishes curated for the st Patrick‚Äôs lunch so had a lovely time and will be visiting again very soon!"
392,Prassun Saha,5,"Brunch at the Cellini, Grand Hyatt Mumbai","Arguably the best Italian brunch in town... And mind you, I've eaten at a lot of places. What really gave me a high today is the variety of deserts they had for the Irish festive brunch. Out of the over dozen deserts I tried, each had a very distinct flavour with a clear taste, unlike all of them tasting the same with differing colours - as in most buffets. The cheesecake, tiramisu, chocolate dipped fruits or the mousse - they all tasted as if made fresh to order, and came alive with a distinct taste each. Pair them with wine or coffee, and it's gastronomic heaven. Which are also part of the brunch. As for regular Italian delights, like ravioli with truffle shavings, crumbly gnocchi with burrata, or risotto with creamy textures - let me tell you, the chef knows his stuff."
393,Nikhil sharma,5,Hotel service,"Visited here for the first time and the experience was up to the mark.

395,Rashmi Rijhwani,5,Institutional quarantine,A very pleasant experience. 7 days stay for institutional quarantine is the most distressing and emotionally draining and to add to it the food served is awful but the Grand Hyatt hotel made us extremely comfortable and served us with very good food.

452,Harshdeep,5,Celini & Soma - Very warm and pleasant experience,"My family used to frequent 55 East before the pandemic. We are already acquainted with the hospitality of Grand Hyatt which has never been a let down, and since Celini & Soma became open for dine in from this year, we decided to visit. I was here with my family on two consecutive days and had food from both the restaurants. It's impossible to write a short review because they have so much more to offer apart from just food experience. The entire staff is extremely warm, welcoming and their energy is just perfect. Hygiene at the restaurant was also well maintained. We had the pleasure of being looked after by Lenzil (Celini) He is super chill, super efficient with his work and really great with food suggestions. In case you're confused, you should definitely go by his‚Ä¶"

I have the Hyatt Dining Club membership so there have been frequent trips. We went for our complementary stay recently. What sets this trip apart is the extraordinary service in the hotel during these chaotic times. Amazing professionalism, courtesy and warmth from the staff. In particular, mentions of our Dinner at China House, where the Head Chef ordered a complementary Dessert for us, and we were immaculately served by Sahil and Vivek (Restaurant Manager). Also worth mentioning is the personal and warm service extended to us at Cellini by Sayandeb (Head of Restaurants).

First off if you book via third party sites the rates are much much lower than what you get via the hotel website. I still don't understand why that is the case. Anyways, it's got a gorgeous entrance lobby and the reception staff is polite and quick at thier jobs.  The luggage did take more time to reach the room which was on the second floor facing the inner courtyard. We prefered this arrangement as we cld see lush gree gardens inside rather than dusty city roads.  The room itself is large enough and well equipped. Although a simple latch of the bathroom sliding doors will go a long way to improve guest comfort especially when there is a you g kid in the room or you have guests (unless you sing all the time inside‚Ä¶"

Suggestion don‚Äôt stay here, mumbai has better properties.. "
523,Sid,2,Hotel has lost its class.,"I have been visiting Grand Hyatt for years now. I only visit Celini as that remains my all-time favorite Italian restaurant.   This time when I visited I observed few things;  1) There were mosquitoes in the restaurant. Which according to me is something not acceptable.   2) Secondly the shopping arcade had a deserted look. The only shops that seem to be running there were Mont Blanc and Omega stores and one or two other ones. It wore a deserted look of an island that has been left before a Tsunami that is about to come. Very dull, depressing and had to leave the space.   3) The Hotel lacked energy and wore a deserted look as if it is about to be shut."
524,vishwas g,5,Official,"Pathetic experience. Only for name , but poor customer dealing . Firstly at reception , the staff is very rude and full of attitude . They won‚Äôt entertain you only . Only 1-2 staff at reception , rest all you can see doing chitchat behind the desk . It‚Äôs very shame for hotel like grand Hyatt that they don‚Äôt have bananas . Won‚Äôt recommend anyone . If wants a good hotel with same price , visit Taj near airport . It‚Äôs awesome . "

526,Rehmat Ali Ramzu Shaikh,3,Pleasant stay in Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"I had a very pleasant stay with my family in Grand Hyatt Mumbai. Excellent rooms, brilliant receptionist, proactive bellboy but very unprofessional waiters and waitresses. Morning breakfast service was awful. F&B staff assigned in the live kitchen were lousy and disrespectful. Manager were helpful and supportive but not the waiters or waitresses. Find was AVERAGE but the buffet setup was a complete mess. Fifty five East didn't provide me upyo the Hyatt standard not even a 5 star property level. Nothing was good from the f&b aspect. Not happy."

Ms Deepa is very sensitive to the guest needs and makes all out efforts to come way beyond expectations.  Mr Aniket is very attentive at his job assigned and is quick to respond when required.  Mr Chandrakant is very hard working and does service in a pleasing manner and with smile.   Kudos to them and their coleagues."
529,SkcChaks,5,Birthday treat...,Some trips are destined and so was this..  Radio mirchi came up with a contest #staycation which gifted few an overnight stay @Grand hyatt Mumbai( GHM).  The gesture was good by RadioMirchi but the experience turned out to be exemplary with hospitality met by the staff of GHM. The first stop was #reservation and a simple request to postpone our stay was accepted with glee beyond the dates stipulation which was unheard and had no obligation ...in the end we got to cheer in our elder son's birthday!! Then was the reception...from the vallet to the lobby there were friendly voices and handy staff all professional and geared in covid style yet helpful.  The rooms were spacious and contemporary with very carefully done decor. The lobbies were lavish and fineart was showcased subtly. ‚Ä¶

The young man at the Front Desk at the time of my check-in at 2pm on 29th Jan was extremely affable and genuine in his efforts to give us the best room with a view even if it took a few minutes longer to find one.  The breakfast haunt, Fifty Five East, had a decent spread of breads, cakes, pies, waffles, eggs, cold cuts, Indian fare, grilled veggies, cereal, fresh fruits and juices and beverages of course.  The service was quick and accurate.    Our dining experience at China House Lounge on the night of 30th Jan was relaxing to say the least, what with the ambient restaurant decor and the niche privacy of our table seating.

But what made our celebration and our stay excellent was the impeccable services rendered by Mr. Manimaran Pillai.

If it wasn‚Äôt Mr. Manimaran Pillai we would have opted for another place. This pleasant experience will really aid in our future relationship with your company.

For 3 days everyday at Breakfast I had to call the duty manager and raise concerns only then I used to get the food. On my last day of stay I had to ask them if water and cutlery was coming from some other hotel because for 45 minutes and requesting 3 waiters it had still not come. While having dinner the Waiter fills 2 glasses of water and some other table calls him and he leaves filling up the 3 glass of water half way and attended the other table. When I called the guest services for 5 times in a span of 2 hours for no one came to the room the issue was yellow water coming in the taps in my bathroom.   I still was very patient and settled my bills but Raised my concerns to the front desk manager Adil Canteenwalla who said I will‚Ä¶

House keeping and room service you keep in calling them but nobody bothers. Only you hear Sorry sir..Then they shift you to a new room ( good on them) but ac not working there too. I was told the new room was personally checked & selected by their Housekeeping head. You are billed for ice cream which you never had and the painful saga continues.

Though Celini is an Italian themed restaurant, the menu had a combination of Italian, Indian and various other cuisines. The kids (6 & 8) had a great time and enjoyed the food too and with the seniors. We explicitly loved the spread starters and the Indian dishes. The desserts were amazing especially the Tiramisu. Renuka did an amazing job keeping the family engaged and serving with an expert understanding of our likes and preferences. I thank Chef Nishad, Chef Selvam, Chef Apurva, Chef Keenan and Chef Shon for the wonderful spread. Thank you team Celine and GHM. Looking forward for future experiences."

Don‚Äôt know where to begin, we received our room numbers 48 hours before and on arrival was pleasantly surprised to be escorted to an upgraded room or rather a suite which had a balcony  as well, with chocolates and fruits in addition to the welcome hamper, dry fruits and an amazing medley of choco bites and pista burgers in the form of a cake placed by the Host.

Large comfortable rooms. Housekeeping needs to be more particular.   The restaurant - China House was great!   I did find that the breakfast team was overwhelmed but the front-desk team obliged to send me my choice of breakfast to the room (great service), in part because I also noticed some guests were not following protocols at breakfast and I did not want to expose myself to that. So my message is that the team is doing really well under the circumstances, the property is wonderful but needs a bit more TLC.   I'd definitely recommend the Grand Hyatt Mumbai."

806,Varun A,4,"Great service from staff, suites needs some color and jazzing up!","Stayed couple of nights at Grand Executive Suite (an upgrade from entry level suite) which was nice. The suite is nice with good views of surroundings but it lacks the plushness of the suite in Grand Hyatt Goa e.g. no jacuzzi, no separate rain shower etc. It's a business hotel hence no ultra luxurious stuff...no kids play area as well which our 3 yr old sorely missed (Camp Hyatt). Food at Celini was awesome, everything freshly prepared and served hot. Chef Nishad was always attentive and with a smile while our servers (Shraddha,Lavlina,selvam,shon) never gave us a chance to ask for something. They could anticipate we wanted something. All in all, a value for money staycation :)"
807,ASHISH KUMAR BAGLA,5,Dinner at Celini,"On 2nd November 2020, I had dinner at Cellini, was very impressed with the hygiene and care by the staff and the requested to meet the chef.

818,sasagos,1,Hyped,"I stayed here for 12 days during July 2020. Entrance to the hotel is good and feels safe. Building looks good both from outside and inside. Infrastructure and construction wise very good. Amenities inside the room very good. Now let's come to the Human Factor. At the reception when asked for a pen to fill up a form the guy at the reception clearly showed his displeasure. Food was room service which is how it should be, but I had to keep on calling them multiple times for breakfast, lunch and dinner the first day. From the second day onwards food came everyday but at different times, which is quite ok because they were understaffed. But the quality of food was so bad. My God! Indian Railway Canteen food tastes way better than Hyatt. Add to it for the 12 days I stayed nobody ever‚Ä¶"

Today I can undoubtedly state that the hospitality at GH can recreate new benchmarks. Custom tailoring of hospitality until today was unknown in large chain hotels until I saw the service at celini this morning while having breakfast with a very picky client of mine. The service made us feel like we were sitting in a first class suite of an airline!!

The staff was inattentive and weren‚Äôt adequately trained to resolve guest problems within stipulated time. The room given to us had some AC problem. After calling the reception several times, a technician was sent after two hours of check-in to resolve the issue. He was in the room for almost 45 mins trying to fix the AC. Failing to do so, the management  decided to allot us another room. There was absolutely no communication from the front desk regarding the room transfer. We were continuously following up with them checking on the status. We nearly waited for more one hour in the previous room and were finally shifted to the other room, of the same category. No‚Ä¶"

The worst thing ‚Äúhospitality‚Äù can do is make a guest (long duration stay) feel unwanted after a while.  I‚Äôm writing this review after personal experience and gathering opinions from my colleagues. So, this is going to be quit lengthy and wordy. If you are looking for brief statements or are just going to give a perfunctory look to this review, refer the first line.  Grand Hyatt sure is an overwhelming experience. Whether it is on the pleasurable side or otherwise, depends on your duration of stay. I am saying this after having a healthy experience; this isn‚Äôt a place for long term corporate tie-ups.

The residences are at the rear of the hotel and have their own reception area. Overall the stay was good for one night. I did find that the apartment was a bit dated and in need of a revamp. The electriticy stopped working in one part of the apartment overnight and I also found it strange that none of the power points in one of the bedrooms conformed to standard plug configurations (my travel adapter did not have any configuration that matched what was in the room - perhaps due to the age of the room). Facilities were good, breakfast was nice - although underground and a bit dingy. We did get a comlpemntary airport transfer on leaving which was a nice suprise.

But it‚Äôs not because of the nice amenities or 5 star feel.. it‚Äôs truly about the hospitality that I‚Äôve experienced in both my stays here. At Grand Hyatt, they go and above beyond to make you feel comfortable. They‚Äôve set the bar too high, because now when I go elsewhere I have a golden standard set by the staff here. I stayed here for my honeymoon and being a Hyatt member I was asked for an upgrade. Upon arrival, I was unhappy with the room I was given for such a special moment and Kevin, who is an absolute rockstar, upgraded us to a room that made our honeymoon unforgettable. Thank you Kevin!!

Check in with Zaki was smooth. Breakfast is a highlight with Juliee greeting us and helping me with my father. Chef Nishaad and his staff run an efficient operation but also I noted how they go out of their way to greet and look after the guests. The dim sum at their Chinese restaurant and the pizza in Cellini is honestly the best we have ever tasted. But what truly marks this place is the consistency of the warmth the staff and I thank all of you for looking after me, my teenager son and my father as if we were your family."

That‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt really get the feel of the Hyatt hospitality this time... from checkin to checkout.  The receptionist greeted me at the checkin and told me he won‚Äôt precharge anything to my card because I was a valued member who has stayed there a few times earlier as well. When I asked about the room, he said yes, we value you and are giving you a courtyard view room. Well, not sure I spent a minute looking at dust-laden trees in the backyard. And the room was much smaller than ones I have stayed in before for much less.  The food - I ordered three to four times - was below ordinary. And then the BKC area being dug up for Metro work didn‚Äôt help either. Overall a very very ordinary experience‚Ä¶"

Has all the amenities that one would expect in a 5 star hotel. Great to see they have a separate toilet. Only issue is that the wardrobe is in the bathroom so when you bath, the steam permeates through the wardrobe to your clothes, but to be fair, this makes it more convenient to get changed after showing.   I had a garden view which was very nice.   Only complaint is that the rooms can be a bit noisy.  You can hear all trolleys that are pushed past your room door including people chatting as they walk down the corridor outside your room.

When I‚Äôve stayed there before- the rooms were sparkling, the service excellent and food delectable. The rooms are now outdated and need updating, I found roach legs in the electric kettle and it took them 1 hour to NOT deliver an in room dining menu because of what they blamed on a technical glitch. If a hotel cannot fix an error this basic, then I‚Äôm uncertain if they‚Äôre deserving of any stars. I understand there was a VIP wedding planned that day, but that‚Äôs unfortunately not an excuse.

1030,pawelhadam,5,Good business hotel,"Very posh business hotel. Everything that one may need on a business trip. Nice rooms, good food, elegant restaurants and bars, nice staff. Well equipped gym, sauna, jacuzzi and swimming pool. Recommended for everyone."
1031,Abhishek,5,Club Oasis Fitness Centre,"Very nice gym and trainer Mr  Justin ,who is very knowledgeable.The equipment is nice and the trainer teaches very nicely and also monitors the movement during the exercise.A must visit whenever you visit Gand Hyatt Mumbai.Highly Recommended.Any doubts kindly visit him."
1032,Praneet M,1,Theft committed by housekeeping,My wife and I had the harrowing experience of dealing with a theft committed by the housekeeping team. The stolen property (mobile phone) was ultimately returned the next day when we lodged a complaint. The weak excuse offered (instead of honesty and an apology) by the hotel team was that the housekeeping team member mistook the phone as their phone and carried it along! It apparently took more than 14 hours for the housekeeping staff to realize the phone was not theirs and during that period the phone with full battery was switched off!! The most disappointing part was that the hotel did not even offer an apology.  The incident took place at the Residence wing of the hotel with the Apartments Caveat Emptor. Stay at the property at your own peril!! 
1033,Atul S,2,Not the best of business stay esp. if you're time crunched,Starting from Check-in which is always time consuming here to dungeon like breakfast area to sloppy service by laundry and stores to the gym with rusted equipment - nothing excites me about this property. I have been and would continue to prefer other properties in BKC for my business stays. 
1034,Balraj,5,Luxurious stay,"Best place to stay in Mumbai, Near airport. Gym here is very good, specially the trainer Justin is very helpful. If you like to swim, then here you have a big swimming pool with Jacuzzi near to gym..."
1035,FrequentFlier260858,5,A Jewel in the crowd,The Grand Hyatt was unlike any hotels I have stayed before. The check-in was very smooth and the hospitality the staff displayed was par excellence. Every service was provided to promptly. The rooms were fantastic and comfortable.  Also for a 5 star Hyatt property I actually found his value for money! Another perk it's close to the Mumbai airport and the shopping districts. I will definitely be recommending the hotel to my family and network.
1036,MarcioMCordeiro,4,Good experience,"Nice hotel with little things to be fixed in terms of maintenance. Great gym. Nice restaurants. A great place to stay but not cheap. I stayed many times and my profile is always wrong at check in, they should fix that."
1037,Sreelal,5,Great place,"Perfect stay...Good food...Great service... Quick airport transfer at less than 4kms.  Well maintained Gym and Swimming pool. Thanks to Mr. Justin (Gym trainer), who was really knowledgable and professional."

1039,pradhanninad,5,Perfect stay,"It‚Äôs amazing hotel. The service is unbelievably nice, only thing was that they charged me heavily for telephone usage and I wasn‚Äôt made aware of that , rest every was just about perfect. Grr how many word fillers do I need here "
1040,abrahamjoy,5,Great Experience,"The staff at Grand Hyatt was excellent & was very supportive. My experience right from booking with Nasima Khan, checkin through Melvina at front desk, chef named Sebastin and finally the staff at the lounge was excellent. "
1041,Ar_Mandar25,5,Mandar M M,This is to convey that the hotel remisses are ace and especially their gym and pool amenities. I want to also convey that the trainer by the name Nilesh Sagvekar was particularly attentive to my needs at their gym. He is the one to seek some tips. I will be coming back regularly.
1042,indian175,1,Not satisfactory,Had severe throat infection after having water from the botteled water provided at the hotel.  Temparature control in the room doesnt work.  I had set it to 26 and it maintained it at 21 throughout making me sick.   Due to a mix up in the lobby I was made to wait for 1 hour (standing in queue) for check-in.
1043,Prof. Reese,5,The Best,"I took 22 university students to Mumbai on a Study Abroad trip to study and volunteer in local NGOs. Because of the intensity of daily life in Mumbai, I wanted the students stay in a nice and relaxing place that would be their sanctuary after their long days. The Grand Hyatt Mumbai was the perfect place. The staff was uniquely nice,  attentive, and helpful. The breakfast buffet was absolutely superb. It was nice to have quality restaurant options within the hotel. The rooms were wonderful and the fitness center, pool, and jacuzzi were excellent. If I could give this hotel 10 stars I would. --Prof. R. Reese"

Very caring Club Floor Manager who personally attended to us during the happy hours. Room was huge with a nice view of the centre courtyard. Breakfast buffet must be the best in town. Check out staff at reception was exceptionally courteous. Must thank Adil Canteenwalla and his team for being so caring. Recommended. 
1047,David,5,Very hospitable and full of warmth,"This is an amazing hotel, except the location. I had a great experience, except front desk quibbling with for hotel charges. Fine Chinese dining restaurant and received great hospitality from the restaurant manager and staffs. Amazing food."
1048,Onkar,5,A lovely place to stay to get away from the hustle and bustle of mumbai,This was a fantastic hotel with excellent services. The gym was really great and staff very friendly. Fantastic bath and shower with unlimited hot water was a great change to the lack of such facilities in many other places we stayed. The bath salts were a great treat. Only 1 minor downside was that the in hotel restaurants are too expensive and should be made cheaper as given the prices not many people eat at the restaurants.
1049,Richard S,5,Great brunch experience,This Sunday we had brunch at the Hyatt. We were a party of 20 and the service experienced by us was world class with nothing that too much effort. The food was excellent and the kitchen willing to accommodate any needs. A great experience and well done to Roger and his team for making our celebratory lunch a good experience.
1050,Globetrotter2815,2,Too busy and chaotic,"We had a staycation here for my birthday and I was quiet excited about it as it was my first time with Grand Hyatt, though we are regulars at the regency this was a first timer.   I stayed with my mother and my son (10 month) old. The reception was busy and I was diverted to the concierge, check in was done in 10 mins and we went to our room, Firstly the property is huge, the number of rooms on each floor and our walk from our room to elevator felt like it completed my number of steps for the day !  room is basic as expected from a luxury hotel but I felt the product is now wearing off, it feels old and a bit outdated specially if I compare it to the Marriott Sahar or Four Seasons. The room doesnt define luxury. plus the service is extremely slow. I had asked for baby proof the‚Ä¶"

1053,Nick B,1,Hotel is awful and in dire need of updating,"Maybe Hyatt as a brand is declining overall, or this hotel just stands out as being awful.  We checked in to our hotel room at 3am in the morning and found the following: hair in our bed, food pieces/crumbs on the floor, water in the bathroom and an unclean sink with dirt all over the place.  My family and I all got bitten by multiple mosquitoes during our stay.    The beds were lumpy and the pillows were hard and uncomfortable.    I would not recommend this as a place to stay."

1059,aditisingh2020,1,Indifferent staff,"First of all, no one assists the guests to check in. When I tried to enter my room, the door was jammed. I called the support staff to come and help me get in. I was made to wait for 30 minutes, and was told that maybe I am not verse with their sophisticated room keys. Finally someone came and found that the door was really jammed and I was then shifted to another room. But the indifferent attitude didn't end here. I was told that since he opened the door with master key, I should go to the reception and have a new room key issued. This is not how you expect to be treated in a 5 star. And even after complaining, no one bothered to apologize or make good their mistake."

1066,RamiaAdnyana,4,Good Hotel Yet Poor Service,I had an opportunity to stay for 1 night stay due to we have an event held in their Ballroom for 100 paxs. The product is great however the service is very poor due to slow service and check in took too long. This is definitely not the service we expect especially when we arrived very late around 3.30 not enough rest and must wake up very early for the event.

1090,abhay k,3,Better plan in advance and choose either a Taj property or a different Hyatt property if possible. Very lousy response,I had a different perception about Hyatt and it‚Äôs hospitality. No wonder my friend told me the Hyatt quality is completely dependent on property and competition in the neighborhood. I would definitely avoid rebooking 
1091,Dr Shailesh Jain,3,Average...everything!,"We got a very small room at first and then they changed it when we complained. None of the requests we had placed while booking the hotel were met. We have a small baby and we wanted an empty plate and cutlery for dinner, but they said they'll charge us Rs. 300 plus taxes for just cutlery, which is absolutely ridiculous! Breakfast was strictly average. Definitely not staying here again. Not a five star! "

Since then, my family and I have travelled to various countries all around the world and one thing is certain, no hotel compared to the Grand Hyatt.   I Went back in a December this year. The hotel is still the undefeated champion for me in terms of value for money, luxury, dining, overall condition of the room and staff engagement.   Best hotel in the world for me 12 years and counting. No doubt that I will stay there and recommend that all my friends do the same if we are ever in Mumbai.   This time the stay was even better with the staff being personally involved in our comfort and going the extra mile with small gestures that make your stay that much better and make you feel at home even though you are thousands of miles away.  ‚Ä¶"

1110,ShawnGovender,4,A grand hotel with some overlooked detail that could make or break a trip,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt hotel after a 15 day cruise and wanted to stay here for it‚Äôs close proximity to the airport and shopping areas. Having said that, anywhere in India is a nightmare to travel to. There is a lot of constructions and traffic jams are a way of life. They hotel is central enough to almost everything and I would imagine that anyone staying here for longer than three days would see the benefit of that. The hotel itself delivers on grandeur and splendor. I loved the majestic spaces and beautiful art. The staff are the hotels biggest asset and their desire to ensure you have a pleasant stay is remarkable. My biggest regret was the quality of the bed. It‚Äôs had either been worn through because of an extended stay or the previous guest was professor Klump.  My‚Ä¶"
1111,abizher2019,2,Hotel should get Grand Hyatt status,"Everything is too basic and old.  Nothing Fancy when you enter, No high ceilings or chandeliers.  Walking in to checking counter is via a staircase.  Counters, carpets and furniture is old.  Room is completely basic, colors are stale and tired.  When you enter the room you feel depressed.  There is no coffee machine have to still use a kettle, mini fridge is empty, towels are old.  Do not see why this hotel hyatt has given it a grand Hyatt status.  "

There was so much for her to do- pool, children‚Äôs play area on Sunday during the grand brunch, Christmas decorations, etc. Most of all the hospitality and service during the breakfast was spectacular . Not only did everyone know my daughter by name , the chef would make her special food due to her allergy and diet restrictions every morning. I can‚Äôt say enough about how great the Grand Hyatt‚Äôs service is!"

1122,Alain Schneuwly,1,Very ppo,I was assigned a room just above a huge party going on at the same time in the hotel.It was super noisy due to very loud music playing. I had to request twice to reception to change room which they finally did but in the first place this room should not have been given to me. The staff knew very well a huge party was going on at the same time in hotel.

He really took pains to guide me with the exercises, corrected me where I was not doing it the way it is suppose to be done.  I would recommend Mr Justin to anyone who is inclined to know more about fitness. He is definitely an asset to the hotel. Kudos to Mr Justin...."

But this time I would surely love to write about your service and hospitality because it was amazing. I would especially like to thank your hard working employee Mr.Sachin Surve he tried to give me the best tips regarding  my health in very few time. That discussion was really very helpful.

The only interesting part was that I was checking in with a male colleague and the lady at the front desk said: you booked 2 rooms, do you require 2 rooms..... Which I found kind of strange and inappropriate. Room was large. view to the courtyard. Breakfast was served in basement with a large selection of Indian food, fruit selection was not very large. I liked the fact that the coffee machine came with take-away cups so you could take a Latte up to your room.  There is a large swimming pool in the garden and a pool bar - they played rock music one afternoon which would not have been my choice of music next to the pool. Pool is large enough for laps and‚Ä¶"

1134,v g,2,Grand hyatt - Another review,"Nothing has changed the ageing hotel is at a good location and has a nice Lobby and a good banquet place. Everything else is below average, the rooms, the service, food. Worst is they are unwilling to change. Shabby carpets in lobby,  broken and overused mattresses in rooms. The buffet place is in basement which gets zero sunshine and has such low light that your energy meter Will hit ground zero first thing in the morning. Avoid this place unless you have no other choice of stay available in that area."

AMOL who is a manager at the front desk is amazing and welcomes you personally from the moment you are dropped off to the moment you depart. He is truly is the definition of hospitality and checks in with you throughout your stay.  Also another employee who is amazing is ROHIT KANOJIYA, who works at the bell desk, he too makes it a point to go above and beyond to make your stay a pleasant and welcoming one. Rohit also is very helpful on about how to navigate throughout the city and what sights to see and where to shop.

My stay here is for two nights (1 & 2 December 19). I was booked at the residences - One Bedroom Apartment.  I must say that I never had such a bad experience with any of the 5 Stars. My reasons are as follows :  Room interiors are old, minimalist and functional. For 14 K a njght I expected a better room.  There is a washing machine but no detergent. There is a steam iron with scratched and burnt plate. Even the water bottles are non- branded. Not even bisleri.  Poor customer service: i requestes them to change the steam iron for the reasons mentioned above. The guy came after 25 minutes with a steam iron equally bad. I explained him the issue and he‚Ä¶"

This feedback is to convey my disappointments throughout my stay in terms of the following aspects:  1. Extremely poor ownership: The staff here always overpromised deliverable that they cannot make it punctually. Examples below: a. The key card always doesn't work when I got back from work and I already made sure my phone did not get anywhere closer to the damn key card. On Nov 26, the same issue happened again so I decided to just pick up the phone at the corridor that connects me to the front desk. I was told at least 2 times for ""5 mins"" but NOT until I waited for quite a while from 8:54pm IST to 9:27pm IST and I had to come downstairs directly without wasting more time waiting did I‚Ä¶"

1151,Tony N,3,Fourth and last visit,"This is our third consecutive year (four visits) and the cracks are starting to show. Having stayed at Hyatt Regency and Oberoi Hotel in the same trip to Mumbai, this hotel is our least favourite. Service and people are great but the facilities are behind the times and you get significantly more value for money elsewhere. Please take note Grand Hyatt and effect change!"

Recommended for all travelers coming to Mumbai. The cost of stay was very value for money comparing other hotels nearby. Love the room. Like almost everything starting from lobby and customer welcome experience.
1154,hkdxbexpat,4,Great Hotel,This hotel lives up to  the standard you expect from a Grand Hyatt.  Rooms spacious and very comfortable. Great breakfast available with very attentive and friendly staff. Gym also well appointed and clean. Would definitely stay here again.

1157,Jaleel S,5,For friends birthday party,"The China house restaurant is very popular restaurant in Mumbai at hotel grand Hyatt. In this restaurant food very nice. Good taste, fabulous dishes. And staff also very nice. Chef family. Chef hum bahadur Thapa, chef Ram. Service staff Bhaskar. Arun, they serve for food food.  "
1158,BornAsTravller,2,Not meeting Hyatt expectation,"Overall it is a hotel within old facility. For example each room door is super heavy and It would not be closed automatically more than 5 seconds. It is very easy to tailgate, not safe at all. The bedding was not clean. One of the pillow covers was noted with dirts. However the hotel does have a good Chinese restaurant."
1159,Arun G,4,My Stay @ The Hyatt,The rooms are very normal and nothing extraordinary for the price (245 Eur/night). Breakfast was good with a lot of options. The pool was temperature controlled and aesthetically well placed. I really enjoyed the pool and services. 
1160,BeenThereandLived,1,Service Fail,"As a Hyatt Globalist, I appreciated the suite upgrade. But the wifi never worked, especially in the evenings and mornings when I needed it. I asked them to fix it, to no avail.   Beyond that, the restaurant service was appalling. I went to lunch at 2pm in the Celini restaurant and it took 30 minutes for a waiter to come by, only to be told they were out of what I wanted. I left. Bar and lounge employees were friendly, but service was painfully slow and inattentive.   On checkout he said ""I trust your stay was comfortable"". When I responded in the negative he ignored me and pretended there was no problem.  Definitely not the 5 star hotel I was expecting."

1162,Ravi S,4,Good and efficient services,The services of the hotel are extremely good and efficient. The staff is quite receptive and helpful. We have been coming here for many years and enjoy the stay away from home. A few changes made recently needs to be rolled back like providing newspapers in the morning. Reading newspaper on app becomes a little impersonal. Thanks for being so hospitable.

Proactively acknowledged for my World of Hyatt elite status, my assigned suite was very spacious, extremely comfortable and exceeded expectations overall - I'll let the pictures speak for itself. But, that wasn't the 'wow factor' this property had for me, it was the dedicated Grand Hyatt Mumbai team - all of them.

1168,pushkarb608,2,A 3-star quality room sold at 5-star rates,"The entire experience of their rooms is way below average and a lot can be done to address the same. The rooms are dated and need serious refurbishing. They are dusty and nowhere match a 5-star's level.  Basic hygiene is a big question in this hotel, right from the room till the restaurant.     I would recommend you choose some other hotel in the nearby area as at the commercial they sell there are far far better options."
1169,KrishnaSarma,3,Ms. Krishna Sarma,55 East Buffet dinner was made special by the Kashmiri wazwan food we had today. Sous Chef Jhupa Singh made the experience really special.  The check in lines were long but I was taken to the FF check in which was quick and efficient. The lifts were not optimal- be prepared to take the stairs for access to the street level access and the 55 East restaurant. 
1170,bobshot,4,Hyatt for 100 USD including breakfast?  Yes please,"Like most Hyatt hotels around the world, this hotel is great.  The breakfast is a huge buffet with western and eastern and Indian dishes. Big room, great staff, and of course it's cheaper than most Hyatt hotels b/c it's in India.  The hotel needs to get a different wifi system and IT help.  That's the only reason I can't give a full 5-stars.  From reading the reviews, I'm not the only person who couldn't connect properly and was frustrated with the login requirements."

However you‚Äôll ignored the same like always.

1207,The Honest Review,4,Very corporate,I stayed here for one night.   The hotel and the rooms are great. Very spacious etc.  Food here was also good. It is a very impressive hotel.   However due to the size of it you do feel like you‚Äôre staying in a hotel as a guest rather than being 100% comfortable and relaxed.  The hotel is also extremely corporate and has a business feel with conferences taking place regularly.   Staff are great here.   My choice would be the JW Juhu 
1208,MiteshAgarwal,2,"Continues to be a snooty, higher than thou hotel.","Continues to be a snooty, higher than thou hotel. Pathetic experience while checking in. Worst are the baggage handlers.

Breakfast staff are lost and one have to follow-up to get an order.  Club access package is worst off, with the most pathetic spread of drinks on the shelf. It‚Äôs worst off that a 3-4 star hotel."

From the point of lobby to checking to the buffets, the staff did a splendid job at ensuring our comfort. I was awed at the service provided by the head chef along with the managers and the waiters at the breakfast buffet. The head chef made us feel very special by always checking with us and delivering different varieties of Indian food to our table. The checking staff (rozelle) along with the bellboy (sumnim) were always helpful throughout our stay.  During our stay even though we booked for breakfast only, we were provided free dinner due to some package going on at the hotel. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable and had all necessary amenities.  Will stay again for sure when traveling to Mumbai!"
1225,Esa khan,5,Grand Hyatt Oasis club,"Oasis club in Grand Hyatt Santacruz East Mumbai , definitely is one of the best clubs.The entrance itself is a giveaway of the club being grand but the facilities offered by the gym are amazing. They have separate area for cardio, free weights, CrossFit, (an AWESOME) which doesn't make you feel claustrophobic even when it is crowded. The equipment's are much better than the life style of technogym counterparts. The Manager Mr Imtiaz is excellent, friendly and always smiling.  Specially the professional trainers Mr Pranit , Mr Sachin and Mr Aashish are one of the best among the training team.  I‚Äôm thankful to them for guiding me in the best way. Club Oasis is Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a good place to workout and have a lively motivating session. Rest Staff‚Ä¶"

1236,drsunil6,4,Cost effectiveness,Grand Hayatt being a established brand should make efforts to make the stay more cost effective. This objective can be achieved either making the room rent a little cheaper may be offering more discounts if stay is extended for more days. Also food seems costly as per quality of food served. The reduction in corporate tax may also be taken into consideration. Would love to visit again with family if offers better rates.

We had booked a veranda suite so we would have a nice outdoor space to use. To be honest the rooms are very clean however a little dated, I can imagine a refresh is scheduled soon. The rooms were thoroughly cleaned everyday but the cleaning team. The suite entitles you to complimentary access to the grand club on the first floor. This a lounge which serves breakfast, drinks and snacks throughout the day and an evening cocktail period. The evening cocktail period had numerous vegetarian and non veg options, hot and cold.

1247,Shivani,4,More friendly and helpful staff,"I was in Hyatt for a business trip twice. The best part of the trip was the the small time you have to relax during the rushed 20 min breakfast they made sure you are set for the day. Helping you with your coffee to go, box for the muffin / fruit, and handling your bag and doggy bag till the car. They just make you feel all set for the day !   The only issue I had was that the bar was kind of spilling over the lobby and it did not have a great ambiance. They should have a proper bar with good seats."

Due to our nature of work, we need a hotel in Kalina area, nearest is HYATT GRAND, also it is required for a few hours. Being a Pilot need some sleep before the next flight.  The Check in and check out is a ordeal, like checking in a GOVT run hotel. It takes 30 minutes to check in and 30 minutes to check out.  Very low experience staff is kept at the reception. They keep saying ""please give me a few minutes""  Atleast 5 times, the same experience. Addressed to the higher ups, no one is keen to solve the problem.

The stay here was awesome as the whole staff was really good. We fully enjoyed the Breakfast time at FIFTYFIVEEAST, thanks to everyone, Lovlina, Saraswati, Renuka, Dimpal, Rita, Dipak, to name a few. Food was great, thanks to Chef Selvam and his team of cooks. The rooms were well managed by the house keeping team, would specially like to mention Devendar, who made sure we have a pleasant stay and homely decor. Kids have a nice play area to enjoy which is well maintained, equipped not only with toys and games but also great staff. All in all, we had an amazing time staying at the Grand Hyatt. Looking forward to visiting again. Rahul and his‚Ä¶"
1273,Andre C,5,Great people great hotel,I just spent a wonderful quick night with Grand Hyatt. The room was terrific but it was mainly the staff that made it so enjoyable. I was met at the front desk by Ms. Shazia Khan. She took care of me in a very timely manner She made sure that everything was taken care of for me and I even got a few unexpected perks and upgrades. These are the kind of things that bring you back to the same hotel.  Congratulations Ms Khan‚ÄºÔ∏è
1274,NPDBMJ,5,Grand experience at the Grand Hyatt,"We had an outstanding experience this past summer at the Grand Hyatt, Mumbai in Kalina. Folks were really cordial and made it an experience of a lifetime.  All of us had a great time just chilling within the hotel premies. The experience  at the Christiaan Georgio salon  was the icing on the cake. The entire crew is amazing. I had the most healing and therapeutic massage session by Apem- one of their therapists. Judy's facial and Jaffar's hair treatment was out of the world. All in all a wonderful break. Thanks to Amrita for helping me plan most of the stay. Thank you Hyatt for the grand experience."
1275,austin.joseph@oswego.edu,5,One Unforgettable Stay,I was just to want to say the experience I had with this hotel was speechless. The room was great and the service of the staff was superb.

The interiors are excellently done with beautiful furniture and pieces of statues all over.  The pool is beautiful. So is the spa and a great gym.  Room: The room was spacious and well maintained. We had a door opening to a huge terrace garden. I loved walking barefeet on the grass after the rains.  Bathroom has a tub and good toiletries. Robe is soft.  Food is good. Buffet breakfast could have more options. I loved the vast array of fresh fruits though. Dinner was great and so was lunch.  Staff is really sweet. They were extra caring as I was travelling with my daughter."

Not having an active workout schedule in the past, justin has been a great PT in supporting my training objectives. He is outcome focused, and I have been able to see continual improvement from my sessions, which are run in a relaxed yet supportive environment. He has helped me achieve my goals so far and I love our sessions. He makes it fun and enjoyable to train and he is very motivating and encouraging To say that he is an absolute pro at his job is an understatement. Justin's knowledge of not just the technique but also about the anatomy, the inner workings of the muscle is astounding.

1282,N Y,5,excellent stay with great service!!!,"I have been there for a week on a business trip.  The reception people were very friendly and helpful. It was very comfortable stay. My room was very spacious, Air conditioning working perfectly, bed was very comfortable and the room was always very clean. Thanks to my room attendant Sameer! There is a huge kitchen downstairs for breakfast, that you can find many different types of breakfast. I preferred to try Indian, which i loved a lot. Sometimes it is very busy that you are offered to have same breakfast on Italian restaurant, so the cafeteria for breakfast might not meet the need on very busy days, bit there is a workaround. There are also Indian, Chinese and Italian restaurants on the ground floor, which you can have your lunch/dinner. The hotel is connected to a shopping‚Ä¶"

1286,Russell G,1,Nothing grand about this place but the price. Very disappointed,"5 star hotel and: 1. It took 4 phone calls to 3 different staff, who promised someone will call me back to fix it and over 90minutes of frustration over the phone to get on the hotel wifi.  It kept asking me to enter a valid email even when I was?? (Go figure).  2. Left the room to work at 8 am and returned at 4 pm - still not cleaned, not touched 3. The price of a drink in the lobby lounge outrageous   4. The wait for food even more outrageous and to top it off the food was cold.  It had obviously been sitting somewhere until the waiter collected it 5. Had dinner in the Soma Restaurant - very overpriced for what we ordered and the food no better than much cheaper and less dressed cafes I had been too  6. The only thing they were good at was charging - very quick, and not cheap.‚Ä¶"
1287,Usha Dahanukar,5,Sunday brunch at Celini,"Thank you ever so much to the entire team of the Celini restaurant. It was the most wonderful Birthday Bash I have ever had. Trishla is a superb manager who managed the event with great expertise and finesse . The boys Akshay,Mayank,Sneedan,Chatrak and Swajal looked after us and all our guests Swiftly and with a smile making everybody comfortable. The bartenders were very good with the drinks . Of course the food was so good and a great spread that it was very tough to try out everything. All of us were thrilled and overwhelmed with the hospitality . The finale of the birthday cake and chocolates crafted by the pastry chefs especially Nikhil and Sameer was outstanding and so delicious. A very very big Thank You to all of you for my most memorable 70th Birthday. !!!!! Bless you‚Ä¶"

1292,466droy,1,Horrible experience at both checking in and checking out,"Even though my business trip was reserved and paid by the department procard, staffs were unwilling to learn the system of business Visa procard, other than traveller can pay the hotel stay charges. This created very unpleasant experience, otherwise I had outstanding stay."
1293,Saraswathi S,3,Not worth the money paid,Paid about 1300 SGD for 6 nights and still breakfast not in my package. Housekeeping did a very good job cleaning the rooms but once the housekeeper threw my shoe boxes away without asking my permission
1294,Paridhi Bhushan,5,MICE event at Grand Hyatt Mumbai,Had an amazing conference at Grand Hyatt for over 2 days with a stay 5 nights. I was thrilled with the experience that we got right from Check in to check out. Banquets team was outstanding as we had more than 3 turnarounds in a day and it was managed all within the timelines-Thanks to Yogesh and team for that. Food as always was perfect for all the palates - Thanks to Chef Rakesh and team for that. Bell desk was amazing as there was lot of material that had to brought up and down from room - Thanks to Agnel and team. Overall thank you to Abhishek Desai for planning this for us. Thank you Team Hyatt
1295,psilvestrelli,4,Great service and qualified trainer in Fitness Club,"All the Hyatt staff is very qualified and always look after your wellness. The Hotel has all the facilities you might look for, only missing a tennis court that would add great value to the structure. Mr. Ashis, the trainer from the Fitness club, is very high level professional, really helpful and nice with clients, I would recommend him also to people coming from outside as members of Hyatt."
1296,Nisha kapoor,5,Excellent stuff,"Jhumpa Singh is very caring person.  Appreciate his time and effort in making our visit to 55 East a success. Very honest and team of passionate people including Sunil Shukla, Vikas, Kilian, Yohan, Suresh, Jasveer and more. They gave us a special service"

1298,Alshaibh,5,Hospitality,I will talk about hospitality because the crew in grand hyatt were nice people and trying to help in any way...one of them was ms shazia..she was treating well and she helped us to see the nice area in mumbai 
1299,Gymrat76,1,Total disappointment,"What looked to be a nice hotel was instead a nightmare of unavailable rooms, poor service recovery and apathetic management towards guests.   Firstly, the airport pickup for a group booking turned out to only have sent 1 car for an airport pickup for 5 pax, plus luggage. The second group had to wait close to half an hour for the hotel to deploy another car for pickup.   Unfortunately, I was in the second group. Upon arrival, we had to wait in queue at reception that didn't appear to move, and we were promptly brought up to L1 for the Hyatt Club check in. This wasn't better as we waited close to 20 minutes for a room to be assigned, after being told that the nom-smoking room I booked was not available.   After finally getting my room, I went up only to immadietely smell cigarette‚Ä¶"
1300,amelia g,1,quite a basic hotel for that price,not worth the money. service isn't very prompt. check takes way more than normal time. bathtub wasn't very clean either. tea bags weren't replaced the next day either. overall not the best experience for the price i paid.
1301,Sangram P,5,Amazing experience,"Grand Hyatt Mumbai undoubtedly one of the best hotel you will ever stay in the city of dreams Mumbai. The comfort and hospitality is unmatched. Love their rooms. The property has  a massive and well equipped gym and a beautiful pool site. Spa is great as well. Food is delicious and the spread is massive. The chefs and the staff here go beyond their way to ensure all your requests are catered well. You for sure will be delighted with the personalised attention that you‚Äôll receive at your dinner table. The staff does everything possible to make your stay a memorable experience. Special thanks to Saraswati, Chef Jhupa Singh, Chef Vikas and Chef Sanjeev and Mr Raju (Laundry department) to name a few for making my stay so amazing. "

Also, chef Nishad, Chef ganesh, chef Rohit, chef Negi & chef khyam  made sure we had everything before we asked for. They made our occasion very special.  Food was excellent, from the spread at fifty five east to the lovely Italian at Cellini & the grand Sunday brunch.  We enjoyed so much that we returned to Grand Hyatt again for a staycation in August itself for my dads birthday."
1304,Oh_Vorapak,5,Nice stay.,Stayed there for 3 nights for business trip. Nice hotel. Great service. Good breakfast. I loved pancake haha.   Hotel staffs were fast & efficient. We also used hotel car for domestic airport Delhi drop-off & pick-up as well. No problem at all.

1308,Travelinhans,1,Do not stay here unless you like to check-in after 11pm & be downgraded!,"Paid ¬£195 per night.  Hotel transport picked us up from airport at 6.40pm so hotel is aware that we are on the way and will be checking in shortly.    Due to traffic we decided to head straight for dinner so the driver dropped us to the restaurant.  We arrived at the hotel approx 10pm & were told room are not ready & we had to wait until approx 11.30pm until all 4 rooms were issued with keys!  Check-In time is 3pm so hotel only allowed us to check-in 8 hours late without any mention on compensation, discount, no visit from the GM etc.  We had been travelling since 6am that morning!  They also breached the contractual obligations & down graded me from a Club Room to standard without even mentioning it to me!  It was only when I asked upon checking out at 7am that the Zishaan‚Ä¶"

Thank You Hyatt once again   Best regards. Rashmi"
1310,Niklas88,5,Luxury redefined,"Luxury is now more often defined in people and hospitality. While Grand Hyatt Mumbai does very well with their rooms, other facilities and in food, it excels in luxury because of staff like Ashish from Club Oasis. He has done not only this hotel but his country proud and in my book is an example of pure class and strength of character. I was an expat in Mumbai for over 2 years and I will remember India and Grand Hyatt as beacons of luxury and soul, much thanks to Ashish.  The hotel should count yourselves lucky to have secured such talent. Spending much of my time in India recruiting staff myself, I know this is very hard to come by.  Thank you Grand Hyatt, and thank you Ashish for an unforgettable stay. In me you have found a lifelong member and supporter."

1318,pareshvedawala,3,Beds and mattresses were not at the standard of Grand Hyatt.,We booked two rooms about a month ago ahead of time to stay very close to each other. At the time of checking rooms were not given next to each other. Rooms were booked on the base of one king bed while we were not given king rooms. Check in process took more than 40 minutes. Beds were very old and not at the standard of Hyatt.

But, my expectations were exceeded by miles during my most recent stay.  Beginning at check-in, I was proactively upgraded on account of my World of Hyatt elite status. Sanjukta of the Grand Club was most accommodating in ensuring that my room met expectations per my preferences recorded in my Hyatt account - Sanjukta was an absolute joy to deal with.  Next up was Shazia whom I had the pleasure of meeting during my stay, she gave courtesy calls to my room and even provided advice on traveling out of the property (e.g. during August 4, 2019 when torrential rains caused Mumbai to‚Ä¶"

The hotel is close to the domestic and international airport, making it very convenient for a quick trip. Exploring Bandra and it‚Äôs nightlife is also easy from this location.  The breakfast buffet was plentiful, with flavors from across the country and beyond. There was also a range of gluten free and vegan options, which was an appreciated novelty.

1339,Jaswantsingh,5,Extraordinary hospitality,We stayed at grand Hyatt on our first day of bombay tour. Hotel was fully occupied on that day so we face little problem in check in but I appreciate the staff they were so polite and attentive. They offer us free breakfast for their mistake and that's worth it. Room was spacious and has all amenities and facilities. Food was ultimate. They offer countless items in their buffet breakfast. I like the breakfast most. One of the most luxurious place I have ever stayed. Loved it.

However, if you are the type of person that wants to carry your luggage by yourself, you will need to go up a flight of stairs (there is no escalator) even to reach the reception.

1357,Ravi B,5,Our Stay at Grand Hyatt,"We chose to stay at Grand Hyatt because we had planned shopping at Santa Cruz west shops.  The hotel is located in a posch area and within a few minutes one can have an auto or a taxi easily if you are not using uber and ola. Santa Cruz shops are located about 5-10 minutes drive. The airport is about 15-20 minutes from here and is well off the airport site.  Check in is fast. The rooms are big and comfortable. All amenities are available.  The breakfast was wonderful with an assortment of international foods. On the north indian side, however, only plain, aloo and gobhi parathas are available. I made a request for poori bhaji and it was implemented next morning straight away.  The staffs are charming, from gate post to security and the waiters as well as the managers all of them‚Ä¶"
1358,Ian B,4,Reliable and functional,The Grand Hyatt is a reliable and clean oasis in the middle of a chaotic city.

It is not especially remote, but it is claimed to me 1 mile from the city center and there‚Äôs nothing to do in 1 mile distance from the hotel.  That said, I would definitely stay there again."

1362,Jose M,5,Amazing people at Fifty-five East.,"I would firstly like to thank Grand Hyatt Mumbai for the wonderful hospitality. Most importantly I would love to thank Fifty-five East and the staff. The staff at Fifty-five East made me feel like home. Every staff was aware of my preferences that I like to have cappuccino and Tabasco sauce is my favourite  and gave me a lot of attention. I don't have to request for anything as the staff knew what I want and what I love to have. The attention they give me shows how much I mean to them and that makes the difference. I would like to mention all their names but it's difficult for me to remember them all, but I'll mention few. Starting with Lovlina, Benaz, Sayandeb, Onkar, Kumar, Amit, Sumeet, Custodio, Bhavika, Mani, Sagar, Prashant, Nutan, Nisha, Farren, Mandira, Priyanka, Parul.‚Ä¶"

As much as I like to appreciate Good work, I even like them to maintain there culture of warm and welcoming. on arrival when I checked in Mr. Zishan recieved me but I think Mr. Zishan had a rough day because there was no welcoming or smile on his face whereas the person next to Mr. Zishan was recieving another guest with great enthusiasm I hope when we come tired from flights ppl have little smile which make our day. Then in breakfast buffet which is outstanding as usual I met wonderful people like Ms. Caroline who was very observant in small details which taking orders also Ms Shradha was helpful and Mr. Satyadeb pal was great person who greets every guest with warm smile. ‚Ä¶"

I visited the Lobby Bar on a few occasions and was looked after with a smile from Manisha, so much she even remembered me and new what I wanted to drink. I have also ate in the restaurants but I feel the bar menu gives me enough because ambiance is spot on. Best bar in Mumbai.

1368,Choongwl,4,Great Club Experience,"I have very good experince in the Club Lounge. Special mention to Ursula and her team (Ashish, Mihir, Vincent and Kevin). Always look forward to the end of day to enjoy the evening at the Club lounge and the great service of her team. As I didn't get an room upgrade upon checkin due to availability of room, Ursula kindly followed up with me to get one the following day but since I have moved in, I thankfully declined. This is the great service I fully appreciate from the Hyatt brand. However the front desk need a bit more improvement. One ""irritating"" point that always crop up is we are required to ""register"" first at the front desk for hotel transport that I take to the office every morning. Sometimes, they would ask me to go the the conceirge counter which is a good walk away‚Ä¶"

1373,BalasubramaniyamC,4,Regarding stay in Hyatt,"The hotel is good but the differential behavior by their staffs are annoying. People should be treated equally irrespective of the vehicle they drive in. In Mumbai due to rain one cannot always find a taxi/cab and obviously auto is the one which is easy to get. It was worst experience to made get down in the road and made to walk along with the luggage in the hotel. How could a hotel like this can ever make their guest to get down on the road just because they travelled in an auto. When inquired in the reception that is there any policy that guest should not come in auto, they said no.. then why I was made to get down? it was so much insulting. We all are human beings, try to treat everyone with respect."

But not so here... The restaurant team always had something new up its sleeve.. Led by Chefs Nishad & Jhupa, they cooked up some astonishing delicacies. They managed to give awesome twists to biriyanis, salads, curry soups and sushi as well!! Even the desserts were marvellous.. personal favourite being Tira Missu (Thanks Chef Sanket). While the chefs were concocting up their magic, the table team of Mr Mani & Miss Benaz along with  Parul, Omkar, Amit, Faren,Renuka, Bhavika, Dimpal, Yohan, Loveleen & Agnel extended superb and untiring hospitality throughout the stay!!

My sister would always be hesitant to try new foods, but lovina made sure she could come up with something that she would enjoy.

Loved how attentive the staff were and very friendly - easy to have a chat with them. Gotta give props to the staff at the Lobby Lounge. We went down looking to get some light meals but the Lobby Lounge was closed. The staff who was doing the closing still attended to us and gave very detailed comprehensive suggestions on where we could go to find what we wanted to eat. Really appreciated that very much.  For me, there was a little disappointment in the food. I ordered in-room dining and the nuggets and pizza were bland. And the masala chai served there, I felt lack of masala. But this is a matter of preference. All in all, for the effort to provide excellent service, I think the hotel deserves 5 stars. "

Location change from Fifty Five East restaurant itself to a more spacious lobby level venue allowing for several more culinary adventures. Upon being seated we were graciously greeted by a few polite, attentive and immaculately dressed staff who from start to finish ensured our thirst was quenched and our plates were cleared.

The hotel food is terrible - from the breakfast choices to the room service. Hotel WIFI coverage is weak and breaks often even inside parts of the room. Although breakfast is included in the room rate, the restaurant staff did not know and insists that it is not."

1429,Damien_BPN,5,Club Oasis Gym,The club Oasis Gym is a great Gym with top notch equipment. I am not very used to gym clubs appart from their cardio training equipment.  As a matter of fact I am often hesitant to use the weight equipment. But in this very well equipped gym you always can count on available coachs. Sachin really did an excellent job today in giving me great advice to practice without being injured. Thanks again.

I was at the hotel with a huge reception desk but only 2 people to do the check in. After 20 min wait the guy on the check in desk can‚Äôt find my details which means another 5 minutes of share your id, tell me address, show me your credit card. Finally I land into this room with a bed which has a worn broken mattress. No it does not end here , the bad experience continues.  So one word, ‚ÄúAvoid‚Äù staying in this hotel. Bad staff , unkept rooms. "

I can understand why your staff is so euthanistic to get compliments from the guests. It has caused a lot of disturbances to us (including my other colleagues). Example:   1) Different staff calling or knocking at your door asking if the stay was good etc. If good, please write in a compliment letter. A personalized service at an appropriate level is good, meaning extra miles to the guests. But by having more than one staff doing this, it creates disturbance the guests especially when we are having teleconferencing or doing our work in the room.   2) During a 1-hour meal at your restaurant, at least 5 staff came forward to ask you if your‚Ä¶"

1502,Kushal Tank,5,Speaking of getting things right,"We went for breakfast as a group of 3.  The buffet spread is good it's got quite a few options to choose from.   The restaurant is designed well and there is pleanty of space to walk around the buffet. The only complain is that it does not offer much in terms of a view, except for a few strategically placed tables.   The highlight of our meal were the chefs who made it special.   Chef Kennan on the fruit counter offered us mangosteen. Which we absolutely loved and that was the highlight of the morning.   Chef Darshan on the egg counter was really helpful and ready to accommodate any and every special request we had.   Darshan was looking after our he was attentive and helpful.   We were finally met by chef Rahul who seemed to be the man behind the amazing meal we had!!   The‚Ä¶"
1503,Bijitendu,1,one night at The Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"Horrible service, no one to take an extra step to help a guest. My tariff included breakfast but I was leaving early and hence I wanted something packed for breakfast and the hotel refused to do so although they were ready to do it if I ordered in Room Service and paid extra for that."
1504,Nikhil J,5,Best place to stay in Bombay,"Grand Hyatt near the airport is an execptional place.  friendly staff, proximity to the airport, and amazing dining options make this a jewel in Bombay's crown.  There is no reason to stay at any other place and based on my experience I am making Bombay a part of my itinerary in the future."

Veg and non veg are co-located and needs a bit of research to see the items available. Rooms are good and spacious. However, the washroom area  doors do not have locking facility. All toiletries are not kept in the washroom and have to be called for. Coffee served to us during the meeting was not hot and tasty. Overall a good hotel."

1515,Gursharanpreet B,4,Beyond expectation,"When booking i read a few reviews online which made me skeptical about my decision but after staying there for 6 nights our whole experience was beyond expectation, from check-in to check-out. We arrived at 11am at the hotel and was ready to wait till 2pm for our room but to our surprise the staff had already prepared our room as they knew we had traveled a long way and would be tired. What i liked most that all the staff has a personal connection with us. 2 nights in a row i ordered dinner and the 3rd night when i just called for a wine, the guy asked me 'how about dinner mdm?' I thought all this added value to our stay and we didn't miss home... hahaha! Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here in my next visit"
1516,Dharmesh Mehta,5,Wedding,We hosted a wedding at Grand Hyatt Mumbai and stayed at the hotel . It was an outstanding experience with best in class service and arrangements . But the one thing which stood out the most was the food . Chef Siddharth personally set the menu and ensured we get the best items in the menu . Food taste was awesome . Divya was very helpful and available anytime for all the arrangements . I would strongly recommend the hotel for hosting wedding . 
1517,adrianloader,4,"up, up and away","Slightly more convenient for the domestic airport than the Hyatt Regency this hotel is a little further away from the main drag with a consequently better setting. It's also the bigger brother with more rooms, more facilities (eg. four versus two restaurants, larger gym/fitness centre) and a more interesting Club lounge. The staff are friendly and efficient but, maybe because of the size, the feel is rather less personal. The bedrooms are well appointed and everything works fine, including the wifi, laundry and room service. I'd happily stay there again but the Hyatt Regency would also work well for a short stay,"
1518,Jo√£o Lage,5,China House Restaurant,A very nice surprise on the heart of Mumbai.  Indra was a great hostess and the food was just wonderful. Almost like going back to the South China Sea. The decoration is also very nice and a very calm environment. A very pleasant choice.

Ever ready to help and make u comfortable. Food at Celina was yummy. The moment you arrive till the time you leave , you are well taken care of. The breakfast served at 55 east is sumptuous and lavish.  "

A well wishes to both of them for future
1524,Subramanyam K,3,Not so pleasant,Not a great stay. Very rigid check in and billing process. Rooms are ageing and average. Service standards have fallen . Rooms not cleaned properly .Had to call the staff and get it cleaned. Spoons not kept for tea coffee. .small misses.. .So overall an average experience. Many smaller hotels have much better service quality now a days. Worst of all when you go to breakfast . Preference given to foreign guests for alloting tables and rendering service 
1525,April Tan,3,Wish I had a better experience,"First night I had a next door guest throwing a party with 3-5 people blasting music, laughing shouting from 2am. Despite my call to front desk, the noise disturbance continued until past 4am and I could hardly sleep even with ear plugs on. Then later that morning another guest tried to enter my room from 4:18-4:20am. So I requested to change rooms next morning. Then I got a bank statement saying I was charged for 4 nights twice upon check in. It was later resolved after I approached the front desk about it twice. "
1526,Ravi Tanniru,5,Great food and Great stay,"Stayed at GH - Mumbai a couple of days back while on official travel. I would say that the hotel was one of the best I had stayed in Mumbai during the last one year (stayed at least in 10 different star hotels last year). The food was amazing with so much of variety, made fresh and delicious. I had breakfast and dinner for two days and had a very pleasant experience. I really liked the breakfast and dinner buffets and loved the dessert collection which had at least 15 (or more) varieties of offerings if someone wanted to really stock up on nice pastries and Indian sweets.   The staff was very courteous and helped with custom preparations what ever the guests were requesting. The rooms are spacious and I had a garden view with nice view of greens (very rare in Mumbai). Thank you‚Ä¶"
1527,Madone5point9,4,Go-to best luxury hotel in Mumbai business district,"I travel to Mumbai 3-4 a year, and having tried the classics in Nariman Point and the sleek neighbours in BKC, the Grand Hyatt Hotel is now without question my go-to home from home in Mumbai. Thats quite a statement since this city boasts some seriously shi-shi luxury hotels, but the Grand Hyatt has it all.   Over the years I have tried all the restaurants and never failed to be impressed, not only by quality of food but also by service, decor, privacy and overall ambience. Breakfast can be a bit of a bun-fight, but if you find a quiet corner, its fine and I defy any guest to complain about the fare on offer. The Indian restaurant Soma is absolutely fabulous and not to be missed. Dal Makhani to die for.   The gym is five star, plenty of options cardio and free-weights. Best way‚Ä¶"

In view of my schedule, Rozelle had already expected my arrival, and prepared all necessary documents for an express check in while walking me to my room as soon as I arrived.   It was fuss free and room was really clean. A tremendously comfortable stay indeed.  The hotel breakfast and dinner was a spread and delightfully delicious."
1534,travelwithkidsTN,5,Concierge at Grand Hyatt Mumbai,The concierge at Grand Hyatt Mumbai went out of their way to cater to our request. We live in the US and we had some friends from here  visit India for the first time. They were staying in Grand Hyatt Mumbai for a week. We wondered if we could gift them a keepsake that is authentic and local. We were already in contact with the hotel Concierge in getting information on some private tours and getting them arranged. We asked them if they could help with the gift. The concierge team went out of their way in providing options for us to select from and actually picking it up and delivering to our friends during their stay in a very authentic way. We are very thankful to them for their time and help with this. üëçüëçüëç

Also your team needs to improve on their food knowledge. Your persons explanation of XO sauce is made of oil and that‚Äôs it.  2. I had made some requests while making a room reservation . However I was being given a room close to the elevator. I had to reiterate the same while I was checking in to ensure the correct room location.  3. Please make no mistake I appreciate the gesture, however during my check in I shared with your representative that 16th March was my wedding anniversary for me and my late wife.

Will definitely recommend Grand Hyatt Mumbai to all. 
1539,DrSJ,4,Good place to stay near the international airport,"This hotel is good with wonderful restaurants and courteous staff. I stayed on the fifth floor overlooking the main entrance to the hotel. The view is good with the fountain underneath and one can see the birds having a refreshing dip in them in the morning. The restaurant attached to this floor is good, however the choice is limited as compared to the main restaurant ( breakfast). The door to the bathroom suite does not have a lock from inside as it can be a bit daunting if you have some guests in the room( please fit a small latch inside) and it has 2 doors as well üòÄüòÄ. All in all a pleasant place to stay."

1545,Trip22707605471,3,Not as per expectation,The location and the hoyel is very good. I liked the way it is been handled. It feels very luxury feeling. But the rooms of this price is not worth the stay. I think last minute booking is not great way to book in mumbai but still the price as per the room is not worth it..

The person for check in Ms Nute was very helpful she understood the needs and efficiently alloted a room as desired by me. Had meals at the restaurant 55 East where Ms Benaz welcomed and assisted us, the food was wonderful, right from the Indian spread to the Exceptional Sushi ( it isn't better anywhere else). Used the gym facilities, here Mr Raghav was extremely helpful, he took time out and personally assisted me through the gym routine. Well, as they say a great place is defined by the people working in it, and these persons stood out and made my stay memorable."
1550,Sundeep K,4,Very nice hotel,My family and I stayed here back in December.  This place is busy!  The rooms were comfortable.  We had 2 rooms.  The one room facing the pool was definitely the quieter one.  The location is close enough to get around all of Mumbai without too many issues and the security is tight there.  The breakfast was decent enough there.  Lots of variety and choice.  We didn't have the same breakfast on any day while we stayed there.  Our ride to take us to Gujarat got stuck in traffic so they were kind enough to keep calling the driver and providing us with status updates while we used the lounge area.  Only 2 things which prevent me from giving it a 5-star review.  I asked several times to get our room super early in the morning as our flight landed at around 4am and we got to the hotel‚Ä¶
1551,Rakesh S,5,Best 24/7 gym in town,The trainers here are extremely amazing. They are passionate and are well trained. They are invested in an individuals progress.

1565,Stuart M,3,Too much noise,Walls are very thin and you can hear most things in adjoining rooms.  The doors are heavy and slam shut adding to the overall late night noise down the corridors.  Fridges in rooms needed to be professionally cleaned or replaced.
1566,Matt,1,Don't go here if you are on holiday!,I have been staying here throughout the past week through work and I can say by far this is the worst experience I have had in a 5* hotel overseas. Twice they wouldn't allow me to post my drinks and food from the restaurant to the room - even though they had my deposit from my card. The service has been awful you usually find yourself waiting a long time for food and drinks. We also ran a number of conferences using their facilities and once again the service provided here was poor considering how much was spent overall. Most of the channels on the TV weren't working to which they blamed their recent subscription problems and offered no solutions. Breakfast you sometimes had to wait for a table because their room was so small it was only on the last day they set up in an‚Ä¶

People were terrible, Price for the food and beverages were extremely high, more than New York and London in five star hotels. I will never go back. The person at check in called Kevin was rude and un-polite."
1569,Nasreen K,1,Great infrastructure with pathetic service,"I have been staying at this property almost once a month due to my work. Each time, it's been an excruciatingly slow check in. The room.service is as slow. This time the housekeeping even forgot to replenish drinking water in the room."

1571,Tilak J,1,Not even a 2-star hotel. Save your money and go somewhere else.,"Beware and go anywhere else!  The staff and hotel is only focused on conference and making profit. If you are going for vacation or personal stay, I would suggest you spend your money elsewhere. The hotel is not focused on your experience as individual travelers or guests.  Few points: - Hotel does not care for your experience even after spending thousands for a night's stay - The staff is not interested in guests but making profits through the many conferences they host - Hotel is understaffed and staff is constantly overwhelmed - Rooms are not sound proof so you hear lots of noise throughout the day and night.

1574,Nasreen K,1,The most pathetic customer service you can ever find. Great infrastructure ruined totally by uncaring staff.,"Definitely not a choice of place to stay. It's got 5 star infrastructure with 1 star service. inordinate delays in anything requested for, no one really cares about the customer. Pathetic service.    After I complained several times, I returned in the evening to discover that none of the things I spoke about had been done.   I have been coming here every month for the past 6 months at least. Each time the check in has an issue. Have given repeated feedback but nothing really changes because no one really cares."

1577,Debashree C,2,Restaurant Fifty Five East - Should be rethink,"Well friends, I am foodie and I went with my team to have 'Grand' time in Grand Hyatt in Fifty Five East restaurant. I don't want to give big review because it was not worth it -   1. per plate after corporate discount was rs 2000 2. Options and food taste was not at all of standard of 'Grand' 3. Ambience was okay but again not expected from 'Grand Hyatt' 4. Very limited main course 5. Very limited chat center - probably I get more option in Barbecue Nation. So what is 'Grand' about it.  Nothing more , my suggestion don't waste 2000 rs from your pocket unless somebody is paying for you :("

Special thanks to the driver that drove me and then walked me to my friend‚Äôs door! And to the bell service who made my departure much easier! 
1580,indiantraveller1104,4,A nice stay,This 5 star hotel is about 10-15 mins from the airport and the first impression ie the lobby and the common areas are impressive. Many options of restaurants to choose from and expensive as well. The room size is excellent and and well maintained although not as fresh as the many new five star hotels in mumbai. They have a lounge access facility which is an excellent concept to have snacks and other refreshments. The staff and polite and smiling. A nice option for both business and leisure.
1581,Jaspreet S,5,Club oasis fitness centre,Worked out in the wonderful facility at club oasis. Gym trainer Mr Sachin was very encouraging and pushed me beyond my limits and gave me a few tips that i found beneficial. Despite being very tired i had a fruitful session thanks to Sachin.
1582,Ashivan,5,Great experience,Very professional and warm personnel. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The room service was also exceptional. The apartment is ideal for a family who intends to plan a holiday trip to India. The hotel is 30 minutes away from the International Airport.

The room was clean, completely in line with what we usually expect from this category of hotel.  Fitness center of very good quality, impressive spa and related services.   Diverse restaurants, offering the choice to the travelers with less time to spend on choosing a good place where to have lunch. The food was qualitative, and the team was always keen to advise you on what you should order (I was impressed by the Indian restaurant there! I strongly recommend it). You may find some shops in the hotel as well. Although of good quality, it would maybe deserve more transparency on the price of the products being at sale.  Well, nothing more to add, a recommended location for business‚Ä¶"

1586,William P,4,Very good but not great,"First class hotel, but clearly takes a back seat to Taj and J W Marriott.   The changes require investment and it seems no funds for investments are available.  Perhaps the management intends to sell the property?"
1587,Prabhakar D,3,Grand incoordination Hyatt,Grand hotel Great service God business halls But lousy front seat with useless people I attended a business meeting  I was lead to believe that there was a deposit being taken as hold and the reception staff was so useless that they just billed me and charged me. Very insensitive to customers concerns.  Disappointed 
1588,hjagtiani,5,A Grand Hotel To Stay In,"Even after 15 years, the hotel is well  maintained to be the preferred place for the annual Nasscom conference. The club lounge is always hospitable and place to relax in or have short business meetings. Look forward to returning in 2020. "
1589,Niteshsubi,5,Amazing service,Team lead by Nikhil Bhavika Archit took excellent care Very Happy with the service   Of the staff. Soma restaurant is one of the best restaurants in Mumbai. Chicken Amritsari is their signature dish and it is must try.  Also Kasturi murgh tikka is worth the try. 
1590,Elisa Andreasson,5,Peacefull oasis close to airport,"The hotel is very close to domestic (10 min) and international (15 min) airport, even if there are closer hotels to it. But if your stopover will be more than few hours, come to Grand Hyatt. The property is in a very quite area, no traffic, no noise, a very nice pool among trees, a very well equiped gym, nice restaurants, and on top of all, a staff of such a kindness, carefullness and  professionality that is more than outstanding. Rooms are not new but well maintained, as well as the rest of the property. I personally found breakfast amazing with a great options for any kind of taste, religion, habit and allergy. Definitely when in Mumbai I will come back"
1591,Vacation07897627563,2,Overpriced mediocrity.,"Unbelievably high prices for a cramped room and tiny bathroom - TV didn't show anything because settopbox wasnt recharged! Light switches everywhere, so provide plenty of time due that before the room is dark enough to sleep. Slow checkin and checkout. Nothing grand about this Hyatt. "
1592,djfowler,5,China house,"I have visited the Grand Hyatt in Mumbai many times and I always eat at least once in China House. The food is always excellent, especially the dumplings. This time was no exception. Especially the lamb dumplings. Great service from Indra and Oreste made this visit as enjoyable as ever."
1593,astetsen,1,INFESTED WITH MOSQUITOES,"My room was infested with mosquitoes, which ate me alive the first night of my stay.  Mosquitoes were also all over the public spaces, including the gym and the breakfast restaurant.  I've stayed at this hotel previously, and noticed mosquitoes during those stays as well, but the problem seems to be getting worse.  While I recognize that Mumbai is in a tropical zone, I've never experienced this sort of issue (certainly not to this degree) in any other five-star hotel in the city."
1594,dsv99,5,"Excellent Banquet Services, Excellent Property, Highly Recommend","We recently had our wedding at Grand Hyatt - our experience here has been excellent in all respects. The Banquet staff and the entire team had exceeded expectations in all respects. Special thanks to Mr. Mahesh Salian, Ms. Divya Nair, Mr. Mahesh Shetty, Chef Rakesh and the entire team who made the planning of the event stress free. The team has been enthusiastic and receptive to thoughts, suggestions, which makes one feel that they really do care. The rooms were great too, large in size, the suites are beautiful. Overall, highly recommend."
1595,Rahul J,3,Staff service could be much better,"I stayed for 6 nights and while most of the things are as what you would expect to see in a Hyatt property. First of all, I am thankful to them to provide me an early check in. However, i was somewhat disappointed with the staff service there. I had requested for a baby crib while making the booking and it was not there and then when i called up in night, it didnt come even in 45 mins while the staff telling me that it will come in 10 mins through my 3 follow up calls during the time.  The staff at restaurant can be lot more friendly and hopefully can do better than saying - no, it can't be done as the first standard response. I asked for a paper bag to take a muffin for my 3 year old daughter and it took them 15 mins, four or five staff asking me different questions and finally‚Ä¶"
1596,Wimukthi,5,Excellent staff and good hotel,"Conveniently located closer to the airport but, it took us 30 minutes to get to the hotel because of the traffic. My room was ready for a early checkin as requested, but there was a confusion with a booking with deferent dates which I canceled early on. Room was clean and spacious with basic amenities you expect from a 5 star hotel. Buffet had a wide range of Indian and continental options and staff was very attentive. As far as facilities are concerned, they have a fairly equipped gym and a nice pool. However the pool can use some regular maintenance. Overall it was a good stay."
1597,Mose H,3,Not a fan,"The rooms here are old and dirty looking. I would guess they haven't been renovated in years. The staff means well, but there are lots of issues. I will definitely look for other options in Mumbai for next time."

Every part of the hotel the staff is there to help make your stay the most comfortable and relaxing. Some favorite aspects were the restaurants, China House had amazing food and the ambience was so cool. The pool and spa were gorgeous and a great way to relax after traveling. The breakfast buffet has so many options including a combination of Indian and American options, the food and service was great. Vipul and Sazia helped us through our check in process and continued to go out of their way to make sure we had the best possible stay. I 100% recommend staying at the Grand Hyatt. "

Rooms were spacious and we were particularly happy with the generous number of bottled water supplied in the rooms everyday. Pool, gym and the breakfast spread were all great.

After checking out and on arrival at my next destination Goa, I realised that I‚Äôve left my mobile phone in my room safe. I emailed the Asst Front Office Manager Mr Vipul Bhosle who had asked after my stay and given me his name card when I was checking out earlier.

1620,AJW,5,First visit to Mumbai,"Made the right choice to stay at the Grand Hyatt. Everyone worked so hard to make our stay wonderful. Too many people to thank... On last day, my phone got left in the airport drop-off car. Mikhil worked hard to help me and coordinated a driver to bring to phone to me at the airport before my flight. A stressful, but perfect way to complete the service from the Grand Hyatt. Highly recommend!"
1621,Lola,5,Exceptional staff,"This is a lovely hotel with spacious rooms and an amazing breakfast. However, what really makes the hotel stand out are the the staff and the service there.

We have booked superior rooms, but got upgraded to residences (which is a proper two room apartment)! The residences seemed a bit worned down in some point but very spacious, clean, practical and with all necessary amenities included in the room!

Midway through our meal, we were told they were doing an ‚Äúaudit‚Äù and requested to settle the bill. While I found it a bit strange, I still paid _before_ our main course had arrived. It was all downhill after that. There was a long hair in our order of fried rice and chicken. When I asked to speak to the manager, the chef arrived and apologised and kept insisting they would serve us afresh even though we said we had lost our appetite. Then I asked that they reimburse the charges for the main course. After a long wait, the manager Joshua D‚Äômello arrived saying they had reversed the amount I had paid and issued a fresh bill.

The attentive staff at the Grand Hyatt was really on top of things and made my stay a truly pleasant one. Concierge members were always ready to assist me and remembered exactly what I needed and when it would be needed. Then, while at the restaurant, breakfast was always a pleasure to enjoy due to the caring assistance by Mandira (who always had my Masala Chai ready and how I liked it!), and then by Parul who was always making sure I knew what I was eating and how to make my stay more comfortable. For sure, on my next trip to Mumbai, I will book a room at the Grand Hyatt, and will be happy to see the friends I made there. Great service, great location, great memories."

Rooms how ever were Dirty, first room had 2 hairs on the bed and we complained they gave another room In which were werent too impressed for 300 dollars a night this place is not worth it, rather have paid another 1-2 hundred extra and stayed at the Taj hotel and south Mumbai   On the 3rd day they changed the bed sheets and I found a blood mark on the bed which I was disgusted to see at a 4-5 star hotel after giving 3-5 USA dollars every day tip for the room service people daily how could they even put these dirty sheets on the bed, room service lady said it was lip stick but it was definitely a blood stain mark.....  Sad to see such a disgusting bed sheet at this hotel after paying top dollars to stay here  ‚Ä¶"

Justin is the only trainer I‚Äôve met that actually takes the time and puts in the effort to get to know his clients so that he can help them. He is full of life and positivity! Every workout is fun and you will push yourself and see results every week!¬†  I‚Äôve learned so much, not only about getting in shape, but also about how the different muscles connect and work. I feel confident I have the tools to continue exercising on my own and the knowledge I gained from Justin  will benefit me and for the rest of our lives.  More trainers in gym should take on this mans approach, friendly and supportive and always approachable. Would recommend  ten times over!"

1636,Coval75,1,Likes to overcharge foreigners,I have been regular at this hotel's spa. I was almost there weekly at the Club Oasis Spa (always when I‚Äôm in Mumbai that is). I usually stay the day approx. 6 ‚Äì 10hrs. I use the swimming pool and spa facilities sometimes gym and I usually have lunch or dinner there. It was my escape from the busy Mumbai life as the spa facilities are good.   I‚Äôve lived in Mumbai for 3 years so have been using it for about that long. Last year however the prices almost doubled originally it was ‚Çπ2500 + taxes for the day. It changed to ‚Çπ2000 + taxes for up to 4hrs and ‚Çπ4000 + taxes for 4hrs and over. I‚Äôve looked into membership the past two years but because I‚Äôm away a lot for work and visit family twice a year for over a month it actually works out cheaper to pay as I go.  Anyhow on my last visit‚Ä¶

There are a few restaurants that I have to visit whenever I come to Mumbai and this is one of them.  You will never be disappointed by the service or hospitality by Raes and Aksahta.  The Food is mouthwatering. It is wonderful in taste, Aroma and appearance.  It is a high-end restaurant but it is worth it."

1641,eat.travel.live03,3,Not worthy of the Hyatt name,We only checked in at 4pm and think we should have stayed at ITC or The Leela as this hotel does not live up to the Hyatt reputation. We have stayed at multiple Hyatt properties including the one in Kochi this time round. Porters were talking to each other grouped at the front of the hotel. Which means if your cab doesn‚Äôt drop you right at the door you will be overlooked. The check in process took forever. The room is good sized and you don‚Äôt feel like you are falling over each other. The carpets are worn and the walls need a coat of paint in the hallways. The rooms are not sound proof. There was a wedding/function happening and we could hear the very loud music everywhere in the hotel. We went to the pool to have a relaxing swim however there was no staff at the pool even‚Ä¶

Corridors, rooms and Club Lounge are in need of refreshment as carpets are dirty and furniture worn down. The Club lounge was overcrowded and I could not find a seat to have an evening snack and breakfast selection was extremely poor. Staff are friendly but lack the professionalism of a 5 star property."

1651,Sid_Kapur,3,Unable to manage conference crowd,"I stayed at this hotel on a conference for couple of days. The hotel has good infrastructure and spacious rooms. However the service was poor possibly due to conference crowd. The check-in service was average. The conference lunch used to run out of plates and food and replenishment was slow. Other housekeeping services were slow.  If the hotel has taken on a large conference, it should make adequate manpower arrangement. The breakfast and food was above average "
1652,Rahul N,5,Excellent property with even more excellent staff,"This is the BEST hotel in Mumbai with the BEST staff. There are two employees who go above and beyond to make you feel very welcome. ROHIT KANOJIYA is awesome at his job. He knows how to treat guests with respect and also is very personable and also makes you feel very welcome. One time I stayed there, he even got me a cake for my birthday and when I went back recently he recognized me and delivered highly personalized service. I only request him to be my bell boy while I stay at this hotel as he is someone who is excellent at his job, I can rely on him to get all my baggage handled properly and also helps me with tips on where to go and bargains to buy. ROHIT should really be a at a manager position as he service is extremely personable. The other employee who is amazing is‚Ä¶"

1662,Diloo,3,Average,"This is the second time we stayed at Grand Hyatt Mumbai. Large property with several good eating places but the hotel hosts too many events & conventions that makes it to busy & crowded. Long lines at breakfast at the coffee shop leading to messed up operations. Rooms are good with large bathrooms & good shower area. Majority of shopping area of the hotel seemed shut, wonder why. Property is close to domestic airport."
1663,Jude Nash,5,Business meeting,It was a pleasant experience to visit Grand Hyatt after nearly 3 months. Usually used to conduct all business meetings here because of proximity to airport and BKC. Had back to back meetings here and as usual is a fantastic place to be in. Courteous staff and good dining. Will keep coming.

1668,Cherylray,5,Great Grand Hyatt,"We stayed here from 24th to 27th Dec 2018. we had a great club room with excellent facilities. The hotel is in a good position for the airports and for taking a trip downtown. The pool area was very relaxing but unfortunately I didn't have time to enjoy the spa facilities, which looked great. The Chinese restaurant is well worth a visit serving superb food. We had Christmas Brunch which was incredible. The selections of food and drink all beautifully presented was second to none, an excellent way to spend Christmas!"

1672,Gervase F,5,A little gem in Santa cruz,"A really nice hotel and made by the staff. The club rooms offer lots of benefits and their cocktail hour is a real bonus. Rooms were v nice, pool ok with limited loungers. Gym well equipped. Only gripe ..... Grocery store downstairs astronomically expensive... 800 rupees for a takeaway sandwich makes it more expensive than room service and 450 For a coffee... when it's the  machine as in the club lounge.   Overall recommend the hotel and upgrade your room"
1673,Suresh D,5,Appreciable Skill of Corporate manager,"I'm a medical doctor who came to attend a conference today at the Hyatt and during my stay, I had an issue that happened at the front desk. There was a swift response from the manager Mohammed Adnan who attended to the situation immediately and the way he sorted it out was admirable and the skill with which he managed it was excellent. He helped manage everything in a very smart way which I'm sure are good qualities needed to maintain standards of a five star hotel! I really appreciate the effort of the management that has taken in good people like Mohammed. Great experience!"
1674,S Oberoi,3,Drab exterior | Average Service | Great Breakfast Buffet,"Location and exterior of the hotel was a bit drab.  The ‚ÄòAll Day Dining‚Äô didn‚Äôt have tandoori roti. There was no shower cubical, the pot was in the cubical instead. The toilet/ bathroom didn‚Äôt have a lock. The food was overpriced; and I am comparing it to The Oberoi at Nariman Point. The advertised king sized bed wasn‚Äôt exactly king size. The staff, in my experience, was not very keen to pay attention - or even take calls. I wanted to order a desert and no one answered the In Room Dining Number. I called the operator and was told I would get a call back. I didn‚Äôt. I called the operator again and no one answered. I had to do downstairs to speak to the duty manager to complain, to his credit he did make the desert complimentary. The hotel courtyard view was decent.  The breakfast‚Ä¶"

People like Kustin and Suresh Nadar at the place really keep tge service levels up. Good pkace to tune up and to relax. This place is also near to bkc which makes it useful. Yet it is a quiet place. 
1676,Roy,1,Poor service,"Good facility but poor service,when we ask for a big size bowl for eating instant noodles they offer us a ‚Äúastray‚ÄùÔºåsorryÔºåthe bowl is too small and they tell me they only have this size bowl,they cheat us like a idiot.And the female door keeper looks like a dummy,seems that they don‚Äôt know how to show their welcome,looks like a statue.The China house is fine but expensive,and they will charge you by USD instead of Rupees if you use the master card though the bill is shown in Rupees ,and the currency rate is poor."
1677,emph22,2,Unspeakable New Year experience,"First of all, I'd like to say that the staffs of Grand Hyatt are always trying to help, but there are several things that I don't think it makes sense at all.   1-Front Office  We had back-to-back reservations, and the receptionist already told us on the day that we checked in that we would be able to stay in the room throughout our stay. Yet, on 30th, one receptionist still called up and asked when we would be checking out and we had to tell him to look for our reservation. I don't feel that this should be 5-star hotel practice.   Check-out procedure was smooth, so no problem.   2- Housekeeping  We booked the room for honeymoon set-up. But there are none, pretty sad, and the facilities are not well-maintained with dust around.   One thing that I don't really understand is that‚Ä¶"
1678,Dilan D,5,Great hotel,"Fantastic hotel. Staff are very attentive and are extremely professional and kind. Well worth the money. Fantastic location, near all shopping areas and great to be so close to airport. One staff member in particular, one staff member that was especially helpful was Shruti. She went out of her way to ensure that we had a fantastic stay and always made sure, day or night, that there were no issues with our stay. Our parents even got a free upgrade!   The health facilities are also 5* upon walking in I was greeted by Sachin, a fantastic personal trainer that works at the gym who also used to be part of the India weightlifting team. He went out of his way to make me a thorough nutrition plan and even a workout plan tailored around my needs. Amazing guy!  Thanks Hyatt. Great hotel."

1682,Jim E,5,Exceptional Hotel,The Grand Hyatt is an exceptional hotel which I would recommend to anyone looking for a luxury hotel in Mumbai.  We just returned from a 9-night stay and found the staff to be professional and ensured nothing was ever a problem.   The rooms are larger than your average hotel room which make them perfect for a slightly longer stay and the turndown service was always on time and to a high standard.   The breakfast buffet has a huge selection on offer and the service provided every morning is excellent considering the huge volume of people coming through the doors. Special thanks to Krish for his pleasant service.  All restaurants in the hotel are excellent. We went to Celini on our last night and the quality of the food was spectacular.

1684,FarAway14213300824,2,Hospitality needs a makeover!,"Their hospitality really needs a check - One of their staff rang the bell and randomly opened the door to my room when I was changing despite asking him to wait outside. He apologised after, but I have never seen this happen at any of the hotels I've stayed in. The room service was not on point at all - everything was delayed, and at times, was cold. They get you tables on which they serve you food. Those tables are difficult to move out of the room if you do not know how to dismantle the table. We called room service repeatedly , who didn't come to take the tables out even once (this was at least for four meals). My partner and I can dismantle any Hyatt table now. The tub was not properly clean. It had bath salts stuck to it from the previous stay, we called house keeping, who‚Ä¶"

1686,Prateek J,1,Horrendous Experience,"We had booked 4 rooms on 31st Dec. When we called the room service we were informed that only for 31st the hotel had decided to charge its guests for ice and cutlery. This was shocking and unheard of! How can a 5 star hotel charge its gursts for a spoon!! Do they expect us to carry our own cutlery and bags of ice?? When asked the reason for this, we were informed that this policy was adopted as the staff would otherwise be unable to cater to the requests of 400 occupied rooms. They even made the claim that no hotel in the world would be able to cater to so many requests. After making multiple calls to various levels of ‚Äòmanagers‚Äô we had to finally walk down and create a scene at the reception to make the duty manager understand the meaning of service. At the end of the whole‚Ä¶"
1687,shopaddict,4,nice hotel but some minor issues prevent a better rating,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 2 nights at the end of December.  The hotel lobby is large and nice.   Christmas Decor was also very nice.  The rooms were large and nice but dated and also seemed dirty looking.  The bathroom was nice but also a bit dirty.  The breakfast buffet was small and very limited compared to others (like JW Marriott) but good quality and good taste of food.  We stayed on the 1st floor, near the breakfast buffet area.  I definitely do not recommend staying there! There were several weddings going on during that time and the noise was extremely loud at 2 AM I had to call management to complain because there was a large crowd either in the hallway or in the area on the floor below.

1690,Sue D,3,Grand Hyatt Mumbai,This is my third time staying at this hotel.   We were a little disappointed compared to the past stays. I understand that it being the holiday and wedding season and the hotel has many functions but many nights we heard so much noise outside our windows and we were on the 6th floor.  We did complain and they were good about it.  I think that if you are not part of the wedding party or events maybe they could put you in a room that would be much more quiet.  We were there last year for New Years and it was not loud at all.   Sanjukta helped us check in and was so pleasant and helpful throughout our stay.  Ramesh K.

He is incredibly commited  to what he does and this comes across in our training sessions.  No one session is the same which means I never get bored and the exercise certainly doesn‚Äôt feel like hard work, although it must be, because the results after few days are amazing!   Well done Sachin and keep up the good work!"

Breakfast is chaotic and food or spread isn‚Äôt good either.  Club Lounge is again average.  Mediocrity everywhere with some elements like pool breakfast slipping few notches below.   Staff is generally good though.   My honest advice is to avoid this if there isn‚Äôt a price advantage. "

Calling it all round destination means it serves a good choice for both wedding functions as well as business events. The coffee shop is too good. Last time had stayed here for a friend's wedding. It had been a good experience at the hotel. The food was very good be it breakfast or dinner and the dine-in service in room was excellent.

Breakfast was a nightmare. Would take me ages to describe just how bad that was. Suffice to say the manager couldn‚Äôt care less. Despite me explaining how bad the service was his response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and that was it - he walked off. Ultimately a complete waste of money and this hotel has let the Hyatt brand down. Big time."

In short - 1) did not read my room requests, 2) finally moved my room to a king-sized bed room request (but never provided the amenity request I asked for) 3) somehow got lost in translation because they didn't read their own system properly, leading to 4) lost my luggage, 5) gave me a completely different room/specification away from the hotel, and 6) brought another guest's personal belongings to me while they were out."

The flight arrived early hours of the day and at around 9 AM, I requested Kevin at World of Hyatt desk for early check in, he understood about my night travel and tiredness, found a room for me and Sazia took me to my room in flat 6-7 minutes. Kevin and Sazia, thank you guys. One thing which sets Hyatt Hotels apart from others, is the consistency in their top class attentive service. This gesture was in their strides.  Room was super clean, comfortable bed and working desk, single lounge sofa with foot rest and an additional stool opposite the desk. This helped me having two meetings inside the room comfortably.

1730,Chandrashekhar G,2,Sad Scary service for a 5 star place,"Went for an anniversary dinner at Soma the Indian restaurant. Arranged for a surprise with giving the card to the manager on duty Hitesh. As the meal came to an end and we asked for the bill, the manager was nowhere to be found and neither was my card. The wait staff was extremely apologetic but it was a wait for 30 minutes for someone to track down the manager and get the card from him. Even then the manager did not appear in person let alone apologies. What was he doing ? Photocopying my card ? Scary as hell for a 5 star restaurant. I‚Äôll be guarding my goods close if and when I go back there."

They could not offer any rooms to our guests (senior officials) and hence we had to book them in other properties.  While doing a program in such a venue, you expect a team at your disposal but here we were having touch time tracing them now an then.  Inexperience staff not aware of when the buffet needs to be opened or closed.  Had to wait nearly for 3 hours post event to settle their invoices.  & much more.  I doubt we would do an event here in the future."

Because its Deepika Ranveers Reception and we are not even allowed to walk freely or see the entire property because we are paid hostages.I know its a private party but we never went inside that why were we questioned again and again at times one person asked me to go out of the hotel until I showed by card. Is this how you treat ?  I have been in trident during IPL season they are fantastic in service. Now that was not enough we thought to dine in 55 east and insteresting thing was no one even escorted us to the table, when I wanted to talk to the manager she just walked out.

1744,BGMD,4,Very Grand Hotel!,The hotel has a very large complex. you can find everything in it. There are a lot of security at the door of the hotel. The same situation was mentioned in other hotels. They do search for entry and exit. Rooms are spacious and clean. In-room safe and coffee are available. They have Whatsup service and one person always answered  the all times and helped with everything.  First time i saw the whatsup service  in a hotel. Room service is very fast. The area around the hotel is pretty poor and crowded. I feel a little uneasy around the police. There are many nice restaurants in the hotel. No need to get out.
1745,QCWilly,5,The luxury you expect.,"Generally a hotel to me is a place to sleep, shower, and eat breakfast. Hyatt covers these basics flawlessly. This property sets itself apart by truly being grand. They architecture is noteworthy. The staff is top notch in all areas of service. And with three restaurants there is no need to leave for dinner. However, I only ate diner at China House is it was quite exceptional.  I travel for a living. My basic rules for dinner are to leave the hotel, not eat there except for breakfast. The other rule is not repeating locations. I broke both these rules this week. So what is it that brought me back to the same restaurant four nights in a row; something I never did before. I mean this hotel has three restaurants, why didn't I switch it up? Quality of the dishes is top of the list,‚Ä¶"

Its gym facilities and equipments are comprehensive and sufficient. Another essencial facility for my Mumbai life is its tennis court where I sometimes play with the coaches, Raghav and Ashish. They are highly skilled training experts and has been always kind enough to instruct me patiently. Just wanted to express my appreciation to those two gentlemen and other staff who have been enriching my comfortable stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai.

I'm very disappointed - not for the loss but absence of sincere efforts form Grand Hyatt Staff who took this so casually after repeated reminders.

Never did we imagine that the hotel and stay was going to be an unpleasant experience. The check in was nothing out of ordinary. The room is quite small, the carpets are dated and you have to ""request"" for the complimentary bowl of fruits . After a long 14 hour flight ,we are ready for some rest after which we ventured down to the lobby . Surprisingly there were absolutely no seating in the lobby due to which we had to spend time standing soaking in the sights of the crowd at the time which a man in black suit approached my daughter and started questioning why we were standing there .

Enough electrical outlets that accommodate all types of plugs including USB. Separate work desk and an area for relaxed reading. Loved the coffee bar inset into the corridor wall. Had some time to take in the sculptures and art in the lobby and corridors. Glanced through the room amenities brochure art pages that hinted at a treasure of contemporary Mumbai art placed throughout the hotel. Pool is a cool 25m of clear, soothing liquid. Then a hot soak in the jacuzzi on the far side."

Service too was a bit all over the place but thank god we had upgraded as the experience in the restaurant was pathetic.   Fifty Five East - Thanksgiving dinner had been advertised and highly anticipated by by us based on which we had purchased a package inclusive of dinner.

Grand Hyatt connected me with the Grand Hyatt Airport Services and they were able to get the forgotten luggage through sending various proofs of luggage ownership and ID through WhatsApp. Once the luggage was ready for pickup in the airport, we went to pick it up. Grand Hyatt would have picked it up, but we were out driving anyway in the area. What an amazing support in the middle of chaos when relocating to a new country."

He gave me the confidence I needed to join a gym and he showed me that a healthy lifestyle can be interesting and fun.  He is incredibly supportive, but you work hard. He tailors every session, so it never gets boring and the chat and banter makes it fly by.

I was able to use their free shuttle to the airport but not sure if you get it both ways (I only needed it once).  Breakfast was a little skimpy but I didn't starve.  I would stay again."

1813,Himanshu G,5,Fitness centre is par excellence,I visited Grand Hyatt fitness gym and I was not aware of the fitness dress code. I was in my jeans. Mr Justin gave me a trackpant and introduced me to the gym. He is knowledgeable and very humble. He guided me to different exercises.  I could see he had a basic understanding of fitness. Five stars to him. 
1814,abbasr435,3,Not as good as it used to be!,"Spent 2 nights here and must say it was different than my previous stays (2016 and before). It‚Äôs the small details that matter and not what I expect out of Grand Hyatt brand standards - the bottled water in room was much cheaper, room service was lousy, no whole fruits in room (you have to call for it), amenities were inadequate, laundry was not delivered etc. Overall, rooms badly need renovation and the hotel seems to be focusing more on F&B with rooms being an incidental. Must say the food here is great but with poor service (restaurants were under staffed, there were too many banquets and other things were comprised). I look forward to visiting back if and when things change. This hotel is not what you expect of a ‚ÄúGrand Hyatt‚Äù. "
1815,Haidar,5,Congratulations on good management,"Dear Reader,   I want to congratulate the management of Hyatt , Santa Cruz in Mumbai, India for having  such great team in the various areas of the hotel from reception, to the restaurants, to the Chefs to house keeping and all, very good people, pleasant, always trying to help, especially Ms. Parul Mourya. I was there a few days around October 22, 2018 and then again from October 27th 2018 to November 3rd 2018, every day she provided warm hospitality, and doing her best to make the stay pleasant and special.

I had a wonderful stay here with always receiving prompt attention towards my requirements. Everything was to a clock work precision. Would like to thank the management for making stay if their clients a pleasant one.  A special thanks to the manager Trishala Desai for her prompt attention at the breakfast table. 
1821,siddhantdatta,5,Great Property!!!,"Grand Hyatt, Mumbai is a great escape for a weekend from the busy city of Mumbai. We were visiting friends in Mumbai on our trip to India hence decided to stay here as it was closer to the airport. Location, cleanliness, hospitality and hotel decor is amazing.   Our initial suite had some water issues, the housekeeping manager immediately responded to our concerns and switched our rooms with an upgrade. There are also multiple dining options on the site. We tried couple of them (55 east and Soma/Celini) and I would give 4.5/5 stars for the food.   I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to mumbai."
1822,GaDawg44,3,Nice accommodations in a distant land,"Stayed four days here, on a business trip. Was in the middle of Diwali, so there was a lot of holiday decorations and the staff was dressed in native attire.  The room was nice, I was able to keep the temperature down, so it was comfortable.  I had the executive package, so morning meal was provided and was very good.   You have to get used to being xrayed and scanned upon every entry into the facility.  Obviously, after the attacker‚Äôs a few years ago, they take their security very very seriously."

Never seen like this in any other hotels! Keep going Grand Hyatt Team!   Will definitely would like to come again..."
1825,Shyamanuja Das,4,The best location for conventions,"Being the venue of NASSCOM India Leadership Forum and many such events, I had visited the hotel umpteen no of times but got to stay here in this only this month, again organizing our own conference.  Best thing about the hotel are its location (distance from airport) and size. So, for anything big, it is Mumbai's first choice.   The rooms were of course nice and big. The hospitality was good. The only disappointment for me, a lover of Indian food, is the limited and repetitive spread of Indian food at the restaurant."
1826,Sunil S,3,Could have been better !,"I stayed here with my colleague for 2 nights last month. Checking process was easy however unlike similar 5 star hotels, none of the staff offered help to take out luggage to our rooms nor did anyone explain about the facilities in the hotel. Probably it was not a personal visit (my thoughts!)  Room was really spacious and well maintained and bed was really comfortable. Since my colleague had forgotten the mobile charger, hotel even provided us with one.   2nd evening I arrived early from work and decided to spend time at the hotel instead of roaming around in Mumbai. I went down to basement to look out for pool, to my surprise it was a bit confusing to find the way and even surprising when I asked a staff, she had to ask someone else to figure out the way, maybe she was new !‚Ä¶"
1827,Jet23924774428,5,Best Fitness trainer - Justin,Was on a leisure trip with family last month. That‚Äôs when I meet Justin in Grand Hyatt gym . Very experienced and friendly trainer. Know his business and helped me learn new simple yet effective workout routines.
1828,Aleiya B,5,Club oasis trainer - sachin, Sachin is an amazing gym trainer who helped me with my workout even though he was the only trainer on the floor.

The best kept secret however is their Fitness center, which boasts of some highly knowledgeable and passionate trainers like Justin. The breakfast and dining experience was also quite good."
1831,Explorer60790138984,5,Club Oasis Fitness center,Sachin Surve  Really a great gym trainer who patiently help you with all queries & explain each exercise with technical aspect & proper emphasis of each part. I wish to learn more from him. He also helped me with a proper diet plan  
1832,hurricanbiker,5,Service total,"I stay frequently in mumbai and there is no alternative to stay rather then Grand Hyatt. It is the extraordinary service and the hospitality which makes each stay to a remarkable experience. Whenever you are in town dont leave prior to Sunday , enjoy The grand sunday brunch, it is a must. You will find never ending specialities from Indian, Chineese as well as Italien cuisine which are prepared by the chefs to it‚Äòs perfection thanks to the kitchen staff and the ambitious waiters. Beside the high quality of food and drinks it is the service which makes the stay so plesant. Specially many thanks to Senthil Kumar and his team from housekeeping they fullfil all whishes even late evening that is extraordinary service!!! I am looking forward to come back!"
1833,DavidKhorsandy,1,Awfull stay,"A real Sad overpriced Hotel. I was not upgraded even though I looked at Hyatt website and hold a life time Diamond card. They would not allow my companion to join me at the lounge. the room was dirty, the floors were full of stain. the sofa had holes on them. the food is average and the price is amongst the highest in the world. the staff are very rude and unhelpful."
1834,Gurleen M,5,Exceptional staff!,"A beautiful hotel with exceptional staff. The outdoor pool was wonderful, large, clean and warm too, it was a great way to start the morning. The breakfast was excellent and there were so many options to choose from: pancakes, waffles, dosas, a live paratha station! The service here was outstanding, the staff were considerate and accommodating for our entire (10 days) trip. They were like family by the end of it. A special thank you to Sushil, Swapnil, Pankaj, Ashwini, Sarswati, Mohammed and so many more. Thank you for your hospitality and I look forward to seeing you all again."

1836,Mohit D,4,Good Business Hotel,"A hotel very well placed if you are in Mumbai for work due to its proximity from Airport as well as BKC, the hotel offers good spacious room and has a small luxury mall within the premise. the breakfast is just amazing with a variety of options to chose and very responsive staff onsite"
1837,Karan S,5,Review For Your Key staff,I have spent about couple month on a business trips to Mumbai and stayed at The Grand Hyatt Mumbai and Happy to Say that the service provided by Mr. Sachin was outstanding:  He goes above and beyond for the guest services and is truly a key staff in the guest satisfaction. I had a pleasure of meeting him and he is truly enthusiastic about hospitality and inherently has a personality that fully fits this sector Especially Fitness . I hope that management notices this in order to grow in the Company and give the right opportunity to the key people.  Many thanks to all. Best regards Karna Sharma
1838,Maheshwar Haldar,5,Amazing ambience and great staff,"Loved the food, the stay and the service offered by the staff. Overall, it was a great experience.  Recreation facilities available are praiseworthy and the location is quite convenient for commutation."
1839,AMIT MEHTA,1,Poor experience on hotel transport,"Hired a hotel taxi for making my business meetings productive . Driver disappeared and couldn‚Äôt be found after our first meeting. On repeated requests to the hotel, they finally connected us. A second time delayed by another hour thanks to the lack of punctuality from the driver. Have raised it with the management at Grand Hyatt Mumbai and am hoping they will get into the details. Pathetic experience "
1840,Anurag R,5,Superb attention to detail!,"While the rooms, and service is as expected from a Hyatt hotel, the attention to detail at the Grand Hyatt is great. The folks remember your name, room preferences and specific requirements too. Even fitness instructors (kudos to Sachin Surve on this one) remember your workout/nutrition regimen from previous visits and take time to discuss progress with you and suggest better ways to stick to a workout schedule. The only one place I'd probably say they have scope for improvement is in the in-room dining. Overall, a great place to stay."
1841,Tushar R,5,Fitness expert and ambience,"I had 2 night stay at grand hyatt mumbai, I was impressed with the ambience and the fitness centre. Especially with Sachin Surve who is the trainer at fitness centre.His knowledge in terms of fitness is to the next level. The dedication and passion which he have towards fitness is the best.he has lot of knowledge,people usually don't share but he is opposite to them He guided me so well,also explained me do's and don't which need to followed.i would say this was one of the best stay which I had. Thanks to Sachin and grand hyatt"

1843,Ing C,5,Gym club oasis fitness centre,"The fitness instructor, Pranit, is really helpful and patient in coaching the right technique. We went through a few sets of exercise for an hour long. The gym is very spacious and modern looking as added bonus."
1844,david n,4,Very friendly and comfortable and close (enough) to the airport.,"We needed a stopover hotel for the night in Mumbai and we had good experiences of the Grand Hyatt in Goa, so we chose the same chain in Mumbai. It‚Äôs not the closest to the airport, but only a short taxi ride away. It is a big hotel but the staff were friendly and accommodating. The room was large and well appointed if a bit bland. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a great choice of western and Asian foods. Only a short stay but a good one."
1845,ckck447,1,Not the Grand Hyatt I know and used to trust,Not the Grand Hyatt I know and used to trust.   Asked for non smoking room and was allocated non smoking room on a smoking floor. Slow service all round with uncaring staff. Room was not properly prepared for my stay with the hotel safe not working.
1846,Shilpen S,5,Excellent overall,"My family (including two daughters aged 8 and 4) stayed here twice in the last fortnight and we loved it. There are 3 stand out reasons for this: (1) the service was outstanding across the board (Sourabh and Sylvestre at the Concierge deserve a special mention); (2) the Grand Club is luxurious and managed by the impeccable and attentive Mohammed Adnan and his team (including Vishal, Kevin and Vincent); and (3) the location (Santacruz east) is excellent if you want to stay relatively near the airport and the Kurla/BKC district. It is also not far at all from Bandra, Linking Road etc. Overall an excellent experience and the hotel is highly recommended. We look forward to another stay soon!"
1847,Andrew S,5,"Great Hotel, Great Service","I recently completed a five night stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai.  The hotel is in excellent condition and the staff is attentive and competent.  The selection of restaurants is excellent.  Soma has outstanding Indian food and Cellini authentic Italian.  On this trip, I had an excellent experience with the housekeeping staff. One night, when I returned to my room, I found a note next to a can of shaving cream.  The note, from the housekeeping attendant, said that he had seen that my personal shaving cream was low and he wanted to provide some additional for me.  Really an amazing example of great customer service."

1850,global citizen,3,VERY OLD !,"The hotel is only 15 years old but it feels like much older. I might be wrong but it appears to me that no investment has been done recently to upgrade the hotel. You book at the suite , be prepared to check in hallway. The club reception is a simple desk in the middle of the hallway.  The suite itself, the sofa is dirty, bathroom is tiles are chipped. The employees are extremely friendly. Location is close to the airport. Next trip to Mumbai, will for sure not stay at this hotel. Too old."
1851,Trail827053,5,An Amazing Experience!,"My love for Italian restaurant brings me to the place Cellini. Have heard a lot about this place and was looking forward to visit it soon. It‚Äôs difficult to find good Italian food and even if you find its too expensive. So coming to the restaurant, I was well greeted by the beautiful lady Purva, and was escorted to a nice booth.   The menu of the Restaurant consist of Italian Cuisine, they just not have good pasta‚Äôs and pizza‚Äôs option but a lot more to offer from the Italian Cuisine. They have a nice wine menu and the right man Soumil to suggest you about the pairing it with food. Being myself a wine lover we had a lot things to talk about and learned new things about wines.  Coming to the food - the sesame tuna tartar, the quinoa dish were just amazing, saw quinoa first time in‚Ä¶"

The gym is fabulous and well maintained, with beautiful facilities and humble, hardworking trainers, to name a few- Justin, Nilesh, Pranit, and Ashish, who've personally trained me, stepped in when I'm doing something wrong and constantly motivate me. They have alot of knowledge about fitness and nutrition, and have been doing a great job everytime I've come here for the past year and a half.

1856,S.G,5,Excellent experience - amazing staff,"We have just come back from a weeks stay at the property. It was the first time visiting Mumbai with children so we needed it to be a positive experience for them which it was.  The hotel is well maintained, spacious and the breakfast is great - plenty a choice and fast service. Parul looked after us well. Love the masala tea being served in the little glasses. Dhosas were deliciously fresh.   We‚Äôd especially like to thank manager  Janvi from the guest experience team who gave us the best advice about getting around the city and where and when to go. She helped us plan the daily itineraries and had colouring books, toys and the best chocolate cake sent to our room for the kids which was a lovely surprise and made the kids happy.

However, since the time I met Sachin who is the trainer at the Oasis gym, I want to keep going to learn more from the workouts. Oasis has a gem in the form of Sachin who is very knowledgeable, compassionate and a confident trainer. He cured my back issue with his simple tips and techniques. I wish Sachin could be available at other gym where I can go regularly, nevertheless, his passion for sharing knowledge is good enough for me to keep going regularly and workout. Thanks for the experience! "
1860,Footprints826771,5,Impressive hotel,"The lobby was impressive, the rooms were magnificent, and the modern art in the convention hall in the basement was awe-inspiring. It was modern art that had substance, too! Bonus. My room was great. The bathroom is such an inspiration to go home and get mine renovated the same way. The interior decorading was soothing. The curtain operates on a switch, too! The bed was great, and it was very much welcome to get a real sleep. The grounds surrounding the hotel are amazing. The gym is truly up to par to US standards as well."
1861,Gopal,4,"Good hotel, great fitness centre, concierge needs much improvement","Visited Hyatt Grand for a day - had some free time due to cancellations if some meetings and got an opportunity to visit the fitness center - great experience there - didn't feel like I am in the midst of otherwise a very busy area of the city.   Special mention for trainer Justin here - and his enthusiasm to interact and train the members. Learnt a few fine tips & nuances of gym workouts - Wanted to have some lemon juice after sweating it out, and it wasn't there - Justin got this organized in no time and had a great workout & evening at this property - refreshing experience.  The bell desk staff, unfortunately were going about their job as part of procedure, and showed scant concern for guest issues - morning after checkout, my planned taxi didn't show up and wanted a hotel‚Ä¶"
1862,Cool18,5,Lovely hotel with very friendly staff.,"Stayed at the hotel last week in the club rooms and the best experience I had was in the lounge. All the staff were exceptional and very friendly, to name a few, Kevin, Mihir, Vipul, Adnan and special thanks to Vincent Rodrigues who made the best tea. He made our first cup of tea at the hotel and the last one too. I felt very much at home and was sad to leave. Nabal and everyone in the concierge team very well helpful too. Chef Chandan made the breakfast experience extra special and one of the best breakfasts I have had. The food was very delicious. Thanks chef for sharing your cooking tips with us."
1863,milindde0re,5,Great experience,Grand Hyatt was a great experience to remember . The hotel staff was courteous and hospitality was excellent. Great Ambience. and Cleanliness . Surely a great place to stay and unforgettable experience.
1864,Stian O,4,Worth the 5 stars - almost perfect,Very decent 5 star hotel like most in this category in Mumbai. Nice and convenient location only about 15-20 mins from the airport pending traffic...  Overall: 4/5  Reception/common areas: 5/5   Pool: 4/5 - could be somewhat bigger and jacuzzi out of order  Gym: 5/5 - big and well equipped  Room: 4/5 - ok size but need refurbishment within 1-2 years. Some strains on carpet  Bed: 5/5  Cleanliness: 5/5  Food/breakfast: 5/5  Service and friendliness: 5/5  Overall very good. With a revamp of rooms this would be 5/5 and good value for money. JW Marriott at airport is a step up but the prices as well so this is a good alternative 
1865,shahrukh ansari,5,Good awesome service,"Customer service was very good. Staff were plentiful and very attentive. Food in the China House restaurants was loaded with oil so i asked them to change it, then the other dish was too salty, so I lost my appetite.... I would compare the costs there to the same costs over here in the U.K, only the standards were lower. The hotel had too many Mosquitos in the lobby area, but they did have pest control zapping them."
1866,His Ex. Ambassador Dr Sir Wishwas Julka,5,Excellent,Grand Hyatt kalina in Mumbai is an upmarket busy hotel. The room rates are very competitive. It offers huge facilities for organising events and exhibitions.  This is quite famous place and very well located near BKC
1867,Rutwik P,4,Impressive gym personel,On brief visit to the hotel and being from a CrossFit background like any other fitness enthusiast I couldn't miss my workout. Hence I used the gym at this lovely hotel.

I was offered a room while checking in by a receptionist, suddenly a new person comes and changes the room and hands a new key. I don't know why? It was 11pm.. i just wanted to hit the bed. I woke up at 1.30AM just to find out there were mosquitoes in my room. I called the receptionist, she says she can send a mosquito repellent.. whattt really.. irritated.. i took a blanket and went back to sleep.  Next morning..

1883,Sharmistha Ghosh Das,4,"Comfortable stay, efficient hotel","Grand Hyatt Mumbai's real clinching point is it's location. Only a few minutes from both Terminals 1 and 2, it is a great choice for a overnight business stay. The food (except China restaurant) is average by standards of a 5 star hotel. Hyatt's loyalty scheme is worse than most other chains. The rooms are efficient and modern, nothing special. Service can be improved. It seems like a chain built on the promise of efficiency, not necessarily indulgence."
1884,Matt Soleyn,4,Good Mumbai hotel with good servicr,"Grand Hyatt Mumbai is a good hotel for both business and leisure stays. It is relatively close to the airport, but Mumbai traffic still means it can be a thirty minute trip. One annoyance is having to do a security check with metal detector when arriving. Otherwise, the staff here are very friendly and helpful all around, too.  Rooms here are nice and have good bedding and bathroom design. There are plenty of power outlets. Wi-Fi worked well throughout the property.  Breakfast here is an excellent buffet, with eggs made to order, many breads, fresh fruit and juice, cheeses, and Indian options such as dosas. Instead of having to wait around, you give your table number and they bring the food to your table. There are other restaurants and bars which had good food and excellent‚Ä¶"

1891,Rani C,5,A FABULOUS HOTEL,"Stayed on the Club Level and the experience was outstanding. Vishal and Vincent take excellent care of your dining. Hassaan, Aaron, and Kushagra make sure all your needs are met promptly- they are all totally professional. The best is being picked up at the airport and being greeted at the front entrance and automatically being checked in while you have refreshments. All requests for your room is met . Chef Brij and hostess Renuka at 55 restaurant go out of their way to make sure you are perfectly happy with your meal and have food just the way you like it. Nothing is too much for these employees.

1898,Rajesh K,4,Great Hotel for a large convention/conference!,"Every time I've stayed at this hotel, it has been for a conference or convention. My last visit was also for the same. The hotel boasts of large seating area in their ballrooms, which are located in the level below. 2000+ people can easily be accommodated, in my estimate.  The service is very good, except in the 55 East restaurant where it was a bit slow. Maybe because of the crowd. The tables at the restaurant are also rather closely arranged. Not very easy to navigate.  The rooms are okay but the one I got did not have a great view. Faced another building up front, which meant I had to keep the blinds down all through my stay. Good amenities.   Checkin/checkout was a breeze - the frontdesk folks were very professional."
1899,Nehathakur00,4,Chic Business Hotel,"Its a very well located accommodation for travel anywhere between Powai to Lower Parel, the staff is courteous and helpful although given to their busy footfall one has to be very specific in spelling specifications for e.g. a smoking or a non-smoking room.

1903,254bart,4,Nice hotel but some areas need updating,"Nice welcome from bell desk and security, but i felt I was a nobody at check in as they tried to fobb me off with a first floor room which from a security point of view I do not do. Eventually sorted out but the view for 7nights not good, one view over staff back area and the other over busy road junction so noisey.   Some areas of the hotel very impressive but the room was dated and not particulary bright. I had hoped to relax by the pool but due to the amount of birds in it and around, plus the noise from the air conditiong unit didnt manage more than half an hour. Also the sunbed mattreses need replacing as they are quite worn.  The main lobby area seemed to have a lot of staff/managers in it but not doing a great deal.  The warm welcome and contious friendliness of the club‚Ä¶"

I would specially like to mention Mr. Sachin Surve who was kind enough to show me around. I must say he is very knowledgeable and Has vast experience in his line. He shared some very basic but useful tips which would help anyone in the long run. I was very impressed with his behavior and professionalism. I would highly recommend this property and a visit to club Oasis is a must. Very happy with the stay and service.
1906,Vasant V,5,Great hotel. Lavish and extensive customer service,"Great hotel. Loved the ambience, rooms and restaurants. The customer service is outstanding and measures with the best of hotels anywhere. The restaurants have great food, but are expensive.

1912,AvantiShirurAmladi,3,Too large that it forgot the basics,"I am a regular Female Business traveler and choose known brands to stay with. Safety, Comfort and Good service are my top priority in that order. During my recent visit to Grand Hyatt Mumbai, it ticked all boxes of Safety and basic comfort but lacked good service. The room was very comfortable, clean and well made every day.Warm welcomes, helpful staff and good food can make a travelers day. But I found it missing. Found the staff too clinical and not bothered about the guest service. In Room dining refused to make small changes to my choice of preparations, reception staff took ages to get me my room, bell desk doesn't bother to help you with the luggage. People skills we what the hotel needs. "

1914,blueocean201016,1,Nothing Grand about this any more,Grand Hyatt Mumbai offers Typhoo tea bags in the room.The mini bar was empty .We asked for Darjeeling tea and there was none . We wanted lunch at Celini and there was a mela at the Sunday Brunch .It would have been perfect at a third class club in Calcutta .The decorations and set up were cheap and tacky totally inappropriate for Grand Hyatt .The food looked completely unappetising .More like a failed attempt at an ostentatious wedding feast than a Grand Hyatt buffet.A large tray of chicken looked like a roadkill. Celini served authentic world class pizza 5-6 years ago now they serve chicken tikka pizza and paneer pizza.The pasta section was messy . There was an offensive strong smell of Indian spices all over the place.We asked a waiter if 55East was open he first said yes then‚Ä¶

The table space allows you to have your own intimacy and you aren't disturbed by your fellow diners nor are you disturbing them. The live counters are decorated with assorted pickles and jars which look lovely.  The food was spectacular. We started off with the beetroot raviloi with goats cheese. The raviloli was soft and fluffy. Beets and goats cheese are a classic combination and Celini stayed true to its nature and did not mess about much with it.

What is subpar is the room interior which has old brown carpet with visible stains (probably from the coffee machines) and cabinets with scruffy surface after years of use. The bathroom is more updated and appears clean. It's time for some renovation.
1942,Aditya T,5,Fantastic stay!,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai, was a great experience. One of the best hotels to stay in Mumbai. Big thank you to Mr. Adil Canteenwalla for the hospitality. Can‚Äôt wait to be back here."

1946,abduljalilmahama,5,An Amazing dinner at 55 East Restaurant,"I have travel to many places and tasted wide variety of cuisine,but my dinner at 55 East restaurant at Grand Hyatt Mumbai was an amazing experience,I ended up going for 2 rounds, food was super delicious.I hardly eat much, Chef Brij and his colleagues, Neman, Urwashi, Arpurva did an amazing job. Their Sushi was very tasty. I highly recommend this restaurant to any guest coming to Mumbai to pass by 55 East for breakfast, lunch and dinner.I ended up taking pictures with such a professional Chefs. Bravo to the Crew."
1947,HarshY03,4,Great service n Gym Oasis,"The property and staff is excellent. The review would be incomplete without specific mention of Club Oasis trainer Mr. Sachin Surve. He is a very knowledgeable trainer and keen to helpout/train/advice guests. His years of experience in training is evident from the fact that he trains each individual according to her or his physical status and level of fitness. His encouraging words always pushing one to improve their form/posture and do various excercises the right way. The gy, setup is very nice!!! Keep up the high standards and good work."
1948,RAKESH S,5,RAKESH SHARMA,"Did work out, it was awesome. Got stretching done by Mr. Nilesh, It was awesome. Gym was maintained in excellent condition. I Love to stay and work out here. Fitness trainer was having good knowle,  Thanks"

1951,komalchomal88,5,VERY GOOD,"The quality and flavours of food were really good, Rooms were clean and comfortable but the size of rooms is a little small than expected. The staff was well trained, very warm and friendly. Overall a comfortable stay. Highly recommended for business trips or travelling alone."
1952,Prakash M,5,Excellent as expected,"I struggle I cities like Mumbai owing to the fast pace of life and the humidity; however, if I still have to go, always try to stay at Grand Hyatt. The place has everything I could ask for after a long day in the city. Rooms are clean and comfortable. What I enjoy the most is the gym though. The trainers are super observant and helpful. Sachin came over and helped me tweak my posture and made me realise I was doing it somewhat wrong all along. Had a nice conversation with him about sports and fitness, was a really enjoyable and rewarding hour or so at the gym. Loved my stay here, would return again."
1953,Ashwin152723,4,Club Oasis Fitness Centre,"The Hyatt gym has an excellent trainer Sachin. He is helpful and always ready to engage with gym users to resolve any issues or receive feedback. There is plenty of equipment supplied for gym users,although the Cross trainer could perhaps be ready for a service as it has become hard to turn up and down when doing the cross trainer .  I especially enjoy the sessions lead by Sachin,who is a very experienced instructor. I would like to see more Sessions .  The gym is kept very clean and tidy generally. It does provide good value for service.  Regards,  Ashwin"
1954,Dhaval S,5,Fitness Center,"Fantastic trainers  at the gym. Nilesh and Justin are great trainers here at the fitness center. Very knowledgeable people when it comes to workouts. Gave me detailed info about how each exercise works on specific muscle group. Highly recommend both of them. Also , the personal training cost a reasonable amount at a 5 star hotel."
1955,Sandy D,3,Missed the mark..,Was here to attend an industry event. The banquet hall was good - spacious and modern. Food-wise they missed the mark. The lunch items were very average with no thing standing out.The staff appeared untrained - I asked for black coffee and was asked back with or without milk! I asked my choice again and got the same response.
1956,GALC1312,2,Tired hotel with no privacy in rooms,"Blackout curtains could not be lowered, consequently anyone outside could see in through the thin day curtains, especially at night.  My request to have it fixed was not attended to. Hair dryer did not work."
1957,C19S89P,4,Business Stay Hosting two Japanese Nationals visiting India,"Hotel was Excellent. Everything was in order. Pub was closed for maintenance a bit setback. The Package for breakfast included both Breakfast and Dinner. Drinks and wine variety available is awesome. Guest where satisfied with all ambience of the hotel. The long walk to reach rooms where a bit disappointing The hotel still infected with Mosquito, in restaurant had a bad experience with the Mosquito biting the Guest. Once it happen we know still the rashes and itching will be there for the whole evening. Seeing this some other hotel guest came along informed us to get some cream from hotel reception he also had the same experience. Bill settlement also faced some difficulty since the Payment for alcohol is asked to be payed from the corporate card so asked the restaurant manger‚Ä¶"
1958,Maulin Parekh,4,Spacious rooms,"Jul 27 night: Stayed here as we had our offsite here. So, hardly spent time in the room. However, the room is quite spacious. The usual stuff is there - a table, a resting chair, bathrooms, etc. Considering we were hardly in the room and went there only for sleeping for few hours, the bed was firm and soft and the sleep quality was good as got up feeling fresh."
1959,SingaporeJD,5,Grand Hyatt Gym,"Well fitted out gym. Great gym instructor Justin Joseph suggested sensible exercises. Very attentive staff. Great sauna and shower facilities. Recommended.   They have a gym (weights room), separate yoga and fitness room and separate spa and sauna facilities for guys and gals.   "
1960,Zeeshan Ali Shaikh,5,Excellent Experience@Grand Hayatt,Grand Hyatt was excellent experience for my Event.Especially Mr. Zaid Shaikh from Business Centre was very helpfull towards our arrangements to be done in the boardroom at business centre. I would recommend this place to everyone who is looking for top notch meeting experience.
1961,Peter S,5,Superb Service and Facility,I suppose this is what one expects from a five star hotel but this establishment is excellent.  The staff is friendly and helpful in a way that comes across as truly genuine and stands out in comparison to what I experience in most of my travels recently.  The facility is excellent as well.  My room was spacious and clean and nicely finished.  I had enough room to comfortably put down my yoga mat which is always a nice plus.  The restaurant options are numerous and breakfast offered everything one could want.  The fitness facility is one of the best I have is among the best I have experienced in any hotel.
1962,dtswk,1,"Wonderful and hotel, appalling management","A simple issue with my hotel invoice has turned into one of the most frustrating experiences I've had with a hotel.  It's been over a week and many calls and emails and still not resolved.  I have now requested calls from management 3 times to get this fixed and nothing.  They don't respond to calls or emails, day after day I'm told they aren't available and will call me back.  Shame on you Hyatt..!  If you have an error with your invoice resolve it BEFORE you pay or it will never get fixed."
1963,Journey78620,5,Good hotel,Beautiful impressive hotel with efficient friendly staff always willing to help. We were given a tour of the hotel by Sanober who was about to go home but took time to show us around. Good buffet breakfast but had to wait a while for eggs to be cooked!!! It could do with more space in there though. The rooms were comfortable and cleaned daily with always a little personal touch. We ate in the China House restaurant on our first evening food was lovely apart from one dish but was dealt with efficiently. Made use of the huge swimming pool with jacuzzi although the cushions on the sun loungers were dirty! Hotel is in a great location close to the airport and easy access to the city.
1964,Srinivas R,5,Good Hotel,Good hotel near the airport away from the bustling city traffic but accessible. Nice staff and good food. The hotel has ample parking and very large banquet halls. The pool is very clean and maintained very well. Rooms are cosy and spacious by Mumbai standards.
1965,Roving819018,5,Great food and service in Soma,First day landed in Mumbai and a first for me as a Scottish man to be in India. Was welcomed like I was a movie star or even more so the president. Everyone is very very friendly and make you feel welcomed. The hotel it's self is astounding and breath takingly beautiful. I decided to taste some of there fine food within the hotel and I opted to eat in Soma. Soma is Indian food and I was not disappointed at all from the service I received while having my meal. Im here for two weeks so I won't be disappointed at all. I would like to thank Kunal and Archit for there great service during my meal. These two experienced waiting staff were very polite and most helpful in helping chose the right kind of dishes to suit your pallet. Again a very lovely place and you won't be disappointed‚Ä¶
1966,NatureLoverIN,5,"Very passionate gym instructor, good ambience and great food","The highlight of my stay this time at Grand Hyatt was the extremely useful conversations that I had with Sachin Surve who is the instructor at the hotel's gym. Sachin not only helped correct some of my form issues but also passionately advised me on many different aspects of keeping fit. This was a first time ever that I came across such a passionate gym instructor at a hotel's gym. Thank you so much, Sachin, for the all the useful tips.  The hotel has a great ambience and a very good place for both business events as well as personal/family visits. There are many restaurants and you would be spoilt for choice. The buffet at Fifty Five East restaurant was very good with a large spread of dishes.  Overall, this is a very good 5 star hotel."
1967,Nairobi75,5,Excellent Hotel with Exceptional Service,"Stayed here in September, 2018. Beautiful big hotel with excellent facilities. Fantastic decor and exceptional service all through. Lovely pool with Jacuzzi. Excellent buffet breakfast. They equally have excellent restaurants on site; China for Chinese Cuisine, Soma for Indian and Celini for excellent Italian food. They also have a lounge restaurant that serves excellent snacks. Their room service is perfect and the staff are very helpful and very keen on detail. The view of the courtyard in the early morning hours is amazing, you see doves playing at the water feature which a very refreshing site. For families they can provide a connecting room and a roll away bed for smaller families that may not need a second room. All in all, basically a 10/10."
1968,viju v,5,Club Oasis/ Sachin Surve,Gym is well equipped for a quick work out.  Worked with Sachin Surve on a personal basis few times. He is extremely proficient in what he does and works with you patiently and diligently. It is worthwhile to schedule an appointment with him well in advance.
1969,RITIKA M,5,Th best birthday celebration !!!!,We decided to celebrate my 40 th birthday at the grand hyatt Mumbai at celini for the grand sunday brunch and my o my what an experience !!!!! The food was yummmy !!!!  The live band playing kept our feet tapping and lips singing along !!! Sukveer and Jazib made sure everything was perfect and Renuka ran from one end to the other to take care of all our wants !!!  Thank you all for making my 40 th a memorable one !!!!  From kids to adults i Highly reccomend for all !!!! 
1970,TravelingMoshavnik,5,"Definitely a 5 star hotel, and it could be anywhere - unfortunately doesn't feel like India","I actually debated whether the atmosphere warrants less than a 5 star rating.  The hotel is meticulous, accommodations lovely, service great, wonderful spa.  But... it could be anywhere in the world, I would've hoped for some Indian character... you decide if this works for you.  If comfort is all that you seek, in this business-like hotel setting, then this is the place.  If you want character - look elsewhere"
1971,TravelmateSEA,5,Great hotel in a rough neighborhood,"I stayed at the grand Hyatt for a few days and the rooms, the service and the general experience was great. The location was very convincing for me as I was able to dodge heavy traffic trying to get to my meetings. Usually I like to take a stroll down the neighborhood but in this case I did not as I wasn‚Äôt sure whether it was safe. The hotel definitely did a great job in accommodating my business travel."
1972,Surender_Ganta,5,Amazing experience,"You have multiple options for Breakfast and Dinner (obvious for a 5 Start accomodation). The rooms have a decent view, but the best part is the bathroom, where you have a large tub with amazing bath soaps. Worth a stay for business or pleasure!"
1973,aneesh,4,Experienced Gym trainers,"one of the reasons i look forward to staying in Grand Hyatt, is the great Gym facility they have and to top it the wonderful trainers they've employed who go out of the way to make you comfortable... or let me say comfortably uncomfortable by way of making you work out according your requirement. Sachin for example understood my requirement of Core training and with a simple Gym ball made me do so many variants that i was done in just 30 mins. Similarly Justin, he is such a pleasant personality, who tries to take care of every one present. saw umpteen examples on how he goes out of the way to help all newbies present."
1974,Bijay Karan mishra,5,club oasis,i have frequently stayed at grand hyatt mumbai. Its a massive hotel with good and knowledgable staff. Gym trainer named Sachin. He is  helpful and very experienced. I enjoy my gym sessions with him. I would recommend this hotel as a must stay hotel in Mumbai.  Overall a good experience.
1975,kjw745,5,good experience,"excellent hotel, great service; staff was very helpful and professional and accommodating.  Would stay there again.  Rooms were excellent, Club lounge also had good food and atmosphere.  Gym facilities were also fine."
1976,AKSood,5,Grand Hyatt Mumbai,Excellent hotel which is closer to airport. A very friendly staff makes your stay memorable. High quality rooms with gadgetry complement the overall experience. Be prepared to be surprised by the experience. 
1977,Diego V,5,Excellent,"This 5 stars hotel is located in a quiet area, which it may be very good if you are a business guest or little uncomfortable if you are looking for Mumbai nightlife. Anyway it is not far from one of the best nightlife suburbs, which is Bandra. The staff is incredibly professional, friendly and helpfull. Being a 5 stars hotel you can enjoy all the comforts and services (concierge, gym, spa, pool, airport transfer, etc...). Rooms are big and cleaned. Maybe a little old fashion, but in general they are very nice. Just a little noisy if your room is located on road side."
1978,BMahapatra,5,Second home,"I am a Hyatt Platinum member and once upon a time when I used to frequently travel to Mumbai, I used to always stay in Grand Hyatt.   It was always a great experience staying here. Then my frequency to Mumbai reduced and so did my Grand Hyatt experience. However last year I did stay once but found the hotel deteriorating as was getting old.  However this time when I got back it was a different experience. They have done a lot of small changes which has got the hotel back to life. Some of them are : 1) the new card swipe system in the elevators 2) the new guest relations attires. The bright red looks great 3) toilet showers  4) replaced the strong room freshners. 5) new hard beds. The old ones were too soft.  Apart from the above changes the basics remain the same. The breakfast‚Ä¶"
1979,Bhavin-joshi,4,This review is more for the health club... Club Oasis,"Well we had actually gone there for a dinner at Celini. Since we live close by and had heard a lot about their health club, decided to visit it to see it for ourselves. Club Oasis, the health club was certainly very nice. Well equipped, great ambiance. But what prompted me to write this review was their trainer, one Mr. Sachin Surve. We clearly told him that we are lazy people and  visiting the gym only for the sake of it but that did not deter him from sharing good tips about health and wellness. Despite knowing we may not join the club, he gave us a tour of the gym. He cheerfully explained each and every equipment and what body part it is used for. He shared very good tips on health and nutrition. He knew his stuff well and was very helpful and enthusiastic. He suggested so‚Ä¶"
1980,stevenwerbrouck2,4,Excellent stay,"Business trip.  Stay in this hotel 4 times a year, as a hub to all other places in India.  Very close to the airport, including free air port transfert. Great Italian restaurant, and excellent breakfast buffet."
1981,MrAwwtistic,4,Huge!,The first thing that comes to mind when you enter Grand Hyatt Mumbai is that it's HUGE! I guess there's only one time I've been to Grand Hyatt for some reason.. The rooms are okay.. The interior can be a little overwhelming for some people.. The facade is beautiful. The swimming pool is gorgeous. They have some of the best restaurants in the city. What else can I say. The event venues stands to its name 'Grand'. Overall a chic 5 star hotel known for its reputation..
1982,maanay10,5,Excellent stay,This hotel is about 15 minutes from the airport.  We arranged pick up with the hotel.  From our arrival to departure it was a smooth ride.  Check In was prompt and professional.  We are club members so each evening at the lounge was excellent with diifeent variety of foods and drinks.  The rooms are clean and spacious.  Taxis are easily available should you decide to go anywhere.  The buffet breakfast was superb with excellent staff and friendly service.  Would reccomend their breakfast package.
1983,Deep Shah,5,Excellent stay with fantastic amenities,"My whole overall experience was beyond par at this property nestled close to the airport vicinity. The staff is courteous and helpful and while I don't miss my workouts wherever I go, I was encountered with Mr. Sachin Surve at the hotel gymnasium who managed to help out with my gym session with great focus and insightful advice. A touching experience adding value to the overall stay. Food was equally delish and rooms were truly neat and perfect. Thank you Grand Hyatt for your warm, heartfelt and joyous hospitality."
1984,Michael Edward P,5,Best Business Hotel in Mumbai,Wonderful hotel. All staff are excellent and attentive.  Highly recommend the club level upgrade.  Great space to hold small informal meetings and relax at end of day.  The gym is the bet in all of Mumbai hotels!
1985,TrailBlazer816069,5,For Christaan Georgia Saloon,Had a really nice experience with the haircut and did get a lot of tips for my hair from the wonderful Shabnam.  Will definitely continue my visits here.  They have quite a few good options for hair and skin care too
1986,Storyteller224525,1,Poor check out n Wrong Billing,Poor check out n Wrong Billing which landed up they harrsassing me to do payment which they or was their mistake of not taking it from me ; 8th Sept - I stayed with Santacruz n took a spa which on check out the person forgot to bill n charge me complain - i was hassared on the phone n upfront in my clinic by Mr Nageshwar Pathak ; Yashraj Solank & Mr.Yasin I never refused to pay so why was i so badly treated n the peron who came to my clinic also - came so shabbly dressed n insulted me n got a wrong bill -- is this the quality service  ??
1987,suman s,5,Good Business Hotel Near International Airport,"Stayed for 4 nights on a business trip. Location is close to the terminals so convenient when arriving and departing. Staff quite helpful , welcoming and understanding. Janvi from Guest Experience dept was excellent and made me World of Hyatt member in no time.  Room was comfortable and well equipped. A variety of restaurants and shopping center with handy ATM is in the hotel. Security appears good. Gym was best I have seen in long time. Very well equipped and of full size and could beat even a stand alone gym. Minibar needs to be ordered which is good that it takes away the temptation and also trouble of accounting for it at the time of check out. Airport drop is expensive than local app based cabs which are readily available. Having more teabags in room supply will be helpful‚Ä¶"
1988,ravi_avn,5,Amazing stay,We stayed for 3 months at the Residences. Highly recommend this place. An oasis of calm and tranquility. The staff is wonderful and truly cares about residents. Highly highly recommend this place to everyone. 
1989,Jwigg2,4,Typical Western Style Convention Hotel,"This is a large hotel located about 20 minutes from the airport.  Surrounding this property  is your typical Delhi chaos so it's nice to come ""home"" to a very clean and well appointed hotel with everything you would expect from an American owned chain.  I had an enormous double room including a full kitchen and two bathrooms.  The rooms are what I call ""convention"" style.  Furnishings are there for their durability and not comfort.  Breakfast was included in the rate and offered an extensive buffet of both Western and Indian style cuisines.  Service here was personalized and good. The concierge desk was very helpful and again service was personalized- they remembered you from day to day and asked about the service they had booked.    Tuk Tuks are the best option for traveling‚Ä¶"
1990,Atul M,4,Excellent property with wonderful staff,"Started here last year around Diwali time and loved their lobby , staff courtesy and every and overall vibe at the hotel.

1991,vivek s,5,Club oasis," I have been training with justin of club oasis for the past 2 months.  My friend  originally introduced me to him and indeed he also still trains with justin and I have not looked back. I know that I would never have achieved the level of fitness and wellness I have , if not for the personal attention given in my training sessions. Justin is always very encouraging and has a vast knowledge of his profession.  Importantly:  1. He ensures that my technique is always correct to avoid any injuries. 2. He is extremely reliable & punctual , always set up & ready to start training ahead of time, with an exercise routine planned  I would recommend club oasis in a heartbeat having also met and trained with a couple of the other trainers in this company. I aim to continue to train and‚Ä¶"

Shabnam and Rahul was so lovely and they listened to my story and helped me pinpoint exactly what I needed for my hair.

Will definitely come back.Wouldn't hesitate to recommend the salon¬†"
1998,Satish P,5,Very good for conferences,"I visited this place often, for attending conference / seminar and for having meetings with small group of business associate.  It's idea venue for having conference / seminar. It can host any number of people, even going beyond 500-600. Various conference rooms can be connected together to make a large conference hall on the basis of number of attendees. The area outside the conference halls is often used for conference related exhibitions or for serving lunch.  The quality of food is very good and so is the service.  Reception and lobby area is large enough and comfortable. On the reception floor too, there are additional conference rooms, with relatively smaller sizes.  The restaurant offers buffet breakfast and I just love it. Good variety, good spread and of course very‚Ä¶"

2002,ashish a,2,Worst check in experience and wrong room type,"This is my 5th visit to Grand Hyatt, Mumbai. Despite being a gold spg and diamond Hilton member, I prefer to stay at grand Hyatt in Mumbai because of superior past experiences. But this time I had an extremely impersonal experience during the check-in process. The agent was in a hurry to checkin in a very mechanical manner. I checked with the checkin agent if there is an opportunity to get a package up grade (paid), and I did not receive any answer. They even did not have any info about inclusions in my reservation with grand Hyatt reservation team had confirmed to me just yesterday night.  Room quality: my room is on 5th floor and is supposed to be a non smoking room but based on smell in the room, I am 100% sure it has been a smoking room before. Also room now looks dated and‚Ä¶"
2003,Sajad A,4,Hotel,"Standing tall in the hustle bustle of city, welcoming staff,huge reception area. Compared to other 5 stars, I would rate it a bit lower cos the room are nothing exceptional. Courteous and very helpful staff."

Special thanks to Sanket, Royson, Madhuri and all other team members for their endless efforts and making the event successful."
2006,Tanvi R,5,Amazing Gym and Amazing Trainer,"I stay in hotels for extended periods of time, and I must say that the trainer Pranit at this gym is one of the best I have ever had. Usually common trainers do not put in the kind of personal attention and continous training behinf one person when they have a whole gym to look after. But Pranit managed to do both, on multiple occasions. I am very very happy with this experience."
2007,ajinkya h,5,Grand hyatt saloon,Good service great experience ...all credit goes to Shabnam....god bless u.. We went first... great atmosphere..Shabnam is good communicative...co ordinative...nice.. gave different look...thanks for an adjustment Shabnam...very cooperative ..gave nice suggestions..
2008,Harsha S,3,Very Nice place,The review is specially for Mr. Sachin Surve who is the trainer in the hotel gym. As work takes us a lot of hotel and I end up using the gym every singal time but when I visited to this hotel gym I got opportunity to meet Sachin surve and I was really happy to meet him because of his knowledge about workout and diet.  He is very model by different way of workout manner he guide me very nicely what is right and wrong ways of workout training. Apart of that was happy to do workout with such professional person which made my day.  
2009,saffronsynergies,5,"Great Staff, Good Service","We did an evening conference with networking dinner for 500 people at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai.  The hotel staff was very helpful and courteous, and very accommodating to all our demands. The Chef went an extra mile to offer us special delicacies for our overseas guests. The entire banqueting & accommodation team went the extra mile to ensure all our guests were catered efficiently, and helped us put a great show.  Their speed at turnaround is commendable."
2010,Evgenii,3,Average stay,It was OK stay. The facade of the building should be clean up more often. Regular rooms should be renovated. It's not a normal business practice when a hotel charges the credit cards using an own exchange rate without prior notification that causes overcharge unless a client ask to revert a transaction to INR Note if you check out you will lose WiFI access
2011,arai7107,5,Great staff,I‚Äôm time and again ...overwhelmed with services provided by the hotel .. the staff of the hotels exudes warmth. Special compliments to Dinesh and Saurabh.. who with their personalised service make the world of a difference.

2015,Choongwl,2,A big Letdown,"I recommended a few of my colleagues to join in to stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai given the experience that I had in other Grand Hyatt in the region. Suffice to say that it was the worst advise I had given them. Most of them didn't have anything good to say about their stay. The Club lounge is not great and service was not what I had experienced in other hotel in Mumbai where Indian hospitality really stood out. Beside the Suite room upgrade that I got, I would still not stay here in my next business trip to Mumbai even though I am a Globalist. I would definitely stay at a hotel recommended by the local office."
2016,Howard W,1,Terrible service. Not a 5 star hotel,Unfriendly service on front desk  Awful service in main restaurant. Long line to get a table at breakfast. When u do then u risk losing your table as soon as u get up to get food at the buffet counter. Waiters will either clear away your table without checking if you have finished or other guests will just take your table. Waiters very slow at serving. Waited over 20 mins for a coffee   Outside smoking area situated below a block of the guest rooms makes for those rooms to be very noisy as loud conversations carry through the windows. Not enough soundproofing   Won‚Äôt be returning on my next Mumbai visit. Much better hotels elsewhere.
2017,manisha k,3,An experience to share-Grand Hyatt,"I stayed in this hotel from 22nd to 26th on behalf of psychiatric conference and my experience has mixed feelings.To be honest the front desk and management people are money-minded and all they care is money leaving the courtesy and etiquette behind.While checkout we requested for an extra hour as our flight was late and they blantly refused.I have never seen in other big hotels like leela or lait. The food was disastrous(lunch/dinner) and charge was sky-high.Only positive thing was behavior of food serving guys(sagar and prasad) of SOMA who were really sweet and explained everything in detail.And NEELESH ,the gym trainer who patiently explained every exercise.Rest it was horrible."
2018,Anil T,4,The Grand Experience Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"This Grand property is just like Mumbai. To the point, no nonsense and it delivers consistently. It is close to the airport with a shopping area behind it. The rooms are well appointed and staff appropriately friendly. The cuisine at its multiple restaurants is good. Also a quiet place to rest."
2019,Prof.Dr. Anu Kant Mital,4,Service with a smile,"Great hotel with good rooms. Was in suite 2143, end of corridor, but very clean and tidy. Bathrooms though difficult to reconcile with as glass door,admittedly with etched hazing in appropriate portion so have to close main bath door if 2 unrelated people sharing. Room service too long and esp tea is quite tepid by the time it comes to you. A bit of fact pointing got better service. But to their credit did inform about ongoing conference delegates all asking for room service. Ambience and general sense.of opulence good. Excellent service at reception and in restaurants. Food is quite good. By wouldn't come here to have a meal from outside.vakue for money ..yes certainly"

2023,ravichandar s,3,My preferred place but had problems this time,"This is my third visit to this place. I love this place so much that once I took my family vacation here. The setting,the food choices , swimming pool,shopping plaza and proximity to airport are my reasons to choose this place.  But this time around I had problems sleeping. Noise from the next room even at 2 30 am in the morning disturbed my sleep altogether and i was not fresh for my meetings. I brought this to the knowledge of the staff on the floor and he even rang up the duty manager in my presence and nothing was done to stop this nonsense. They have kept a prompt silence policy after certain hours but I‚Äôm shocked about the way my complaint was treated. Now probably grand Hyatt is out of my radar. Avoid room no 2021 if at all you stay there. Even conversations from the‚Ä¶"

2054,kevalc11,3,Great 5 star property,This hotel is a great get away if you are from mumbai. this place is right in the middle of the city but way far away from the noise and busy life of the city. It is quite close by to the airport as well.

The equipment is new and in very good condition. The trainers are giving individual attention to people who are using the gym. The moment I stepped off the cross trainer, one of the gym trainers Sachin came and asked me whether I wanted any specific guidance and I said yes. He guides me throughout the workout. Breakfast spread is good. The food is of good quality. I will stay at this location again."
2058,Manuvel M,5,Club oasis fitness centre,Excellent personal training given by junior national champion in body building Mr. Sachin Surve who is one of the trainer in the fitness centre.

The restaurants are good and the fitness centre is well equipped and staffed well. The trainers are great. Trainer Justin is friendly and helpful in the gym. "
2061,Graham B,5,A great place!,Had a really lovely stay here. Really appreciated the warmth and friendliness of the staff. Shout out to Arunava who was a gute help and very accommodating.  The one thing I'd watch for is the billing here at check out. We had a few discrepancies on our total. Aside of that our stay was absolutely delightful. 
2062,sshyan,4,Comfortable stay when on Business,"I have stayed there countless times. First i must say the lobby is lovely...posh but cosy.

2065,Swarna R,2,Grand chaos,There is a unique lock system in the doors to the room. No body mentions about the uniqueness until you figure it out by looking at the card key or else you return back from your room to the reception. The menu in the buffet is pretty much the same and the service is damn slow. Most of the guests are corporate clients and even then this is what they have to offer. I wonder what it would be like to visit this property as an individual.
2066,Dr.Rohan SP,5,best place for Business meetings,"Had a wonderful time attending business meet and conference here . Pleasant experience  Very well co operative staff . This was the second time of visit in last 3 months . Very well located , can accommodate large number of people ."

Little smelly hotel entrance at front desk but good and clean rooms. May be the best choice which is close to airport. Members lounge has less food and beverage options according to its price so less price for value. If they can improve it, that will be perfect.  "
2070,doctor1963,5,Always great.,"Been here many times.Always pleant quick no fuss check in. Rooms are nice.housekeeping good. They can manage huge crowds professionally, without making a mess. The conference was a massive affair yet they managed it well. Of course the conference make shift breakfast is a bit of a let down but guess there was no option. Gym is nice spacious and cool. Spa is nice too.they should not allow squealing kids there.its supposed to be a nice silent place to relax.please look into that,Mr pool Manager. All in all it's one of my favorite hotel in Mumbai."
2071,CortinaInnandResort,5,Great Hotel and Stay,"I visited this hotel recently and find it very luxurious.This hotel is luxurious with great staff, spacious room and well maintained amenities.

2072,Yujin K,5,Ideal for a long stay.,Flexible staff and good variety of restaurants are the two major strengths of this hotel. A bakery is also convenient. It starts at 7.00 am. The hotel is near to BKC and the airport. (About 20 minutes by car to each.) Ideal for a long stay.

2075,Aaron R,4,Great Hotel and Great Staff,"I stayed at the Mumbai Hyatt last week and after my last Hyatt visits in other countries being less than pleasurable, this one was great.  Upon telling staff my issues with Hyatt Regency Delhi, they really took care of me and made me feel appreciated.  I have to say, the Chinese restaurant at this hotel was AMAZING.  The food was so excellent, and I lived in China for 15 years and I was still impressed.  I would definitely recommend this hotel, the only reason not for 5 stars in the location, its pretty isolated, but service is amazing."
2076,tejinder2018,1,check in,Check in process was poor ... staff isn't accommodating at all .... duty manager don't attend even if there is an escalation on front desk.... this is start of a bad experience of your stay .... they are rigid 
2077,Harsh R,5,Workout session,"Went there for a workout session. The gym is really amazing according to a hotel gym. It's very spacious and nicely maintained and the most important thing is that if a beginner needs any help in the gym the trainers are super co-operative.

2078,lidiahume,5,Outstanding Service in Mumbai,"I have traveled pretty much all over the world, but this hotel would have to be my all time favorite.

The food is unarguably excellent as befits a 5 star rating. We dined at the Celini Italian restaurant and The Grand club. Both were great in their own ways.Well done chefs! Celini offers authentic Italian food in a great ambience and live kitchen. The Grand club serves the best cakes, croissants and breads. We stayed in the Grand club room and it was very spacious with all the modern amenities and a good view of the city. The room service was excellent and discreet. The ambience was quiet and‚Ä¶"
2091,rajatsharma1985,5,Fitness Centre,I frequently visit the fitness centre at Grand Hyatt Mumbai and I must say that its one of the best gym I have been to.  The work out equipment is one of the best and very well maintained. Also cleanliness and hygiene is given utmost importance.   I happened to work out under Mr. Justin who is a trainer working there. And I must say that his knowledge about the subject is very good and vast. He guided me through proper form and actively takes part in activities of people going around him in the gym.  I thank Mr. Justin once again for his time and knowledge.  Wish Grand Hyatt fitness centre all the best and please keep up this good work.  Thanks and Regards. Rajat Sharma.

2098,Saadia Z,4,Conveniently located near airport,The hotel is conveniently located near the airport. There are no amenities nearby but the hotel has a shopping arcade and several in-house restaurants. Though some of them were closed while i was there due to a large wedding. The check-in staff could have been a bit more efficient as it took them almost 20 over minutes to do a check-in for three. We arrived after 1.30 am and would have been nice to receive a complimentary warm drink as we were delayed at the airport. There was a musty and perspiration smell emanating from the carpets and sofa in the lobby. The room was adequately equipped. One gripe is i was informed by their customer service operator when i called to check if i can order from an external vendor. I only had to collect it from the reception. But when the delivery‚Ä¶

They're really good! I'd recommend them strongly!  I enrolled twice over, back to back and this would've been a 5üåü rating but sadly I'm disappointed with the Manager Imtiaz there. He isn't very welcoming and I didn't have the best experience coordinating with him. I mean I'd rather not have even the least that I did. I really loved my classes except this being the only deterrent. I was to enroll for a third time but he disagreed to let me continue at the mutually agreed fee insisting that I've learned well and don't need to continue with ""classes"", despite me mentioning I'd like to go ahead and learn more.

2102,Anu Gupta,1,Pathetic,"@GrandHyattMum the most pathetic hotel we have ever been. Fake courtesy without sensitivity. Seems Staff is specifically trained to not use their brains at all. It's just been a day and already had lined bad experiences. To begin with we were given room with queen size bed instead of king size for which we had paid extra.  Traveling with my 2.5 year old daughter who is not keeping well and didn't eat anything in the breakfast and I requested them to pack one plain paratha in case she feels hungry later (we had an appointment with doctor). We had paid for the breakfast buffet for my daughter and requested only for one paratha, for which were told long list of rules. Had to speak to someone senior to get this request answered. The staff has no sense to identify the difference‚Ä¶"

2104,TheWanderbee,4,Good place to stay near the airport,The distance from the airport is a plus point to stay at the Grand Hyatt. The rooms are fairly decent sized. I had breakfast there which had a good spread though I wouldn't say it was worth boasting about. The room was ok in size. The staff was attentive. They actually put some extra banana chips in my room as a demonstration of care for a solo woman traveler. Tried the salon there which was quite understaffed. Though they were good in their services but 2 people would definitely not been able to attend to more guests specially if there is a party or conference in the hotel.  The banquet hall is pretty big. Could easily accommodate a few hundred people. The hotel lobby is also quite grand. Overall worth a stay. There are many good eating joints nearby if you would like to‚Ä¶

The bed was comfortable, slept well.  Had ordered my dinner on all four nights, the food served was good. Only issue with room service is that at times you have to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to put in your order as the number is busy. The buffet breakfast is a good spread with a good staff at your service, except for the staff manning the ""Eggs to Order"" station. The staff manning the ""Eggs to Order"" station is lousy and need to pull up their socks as their pathetic service is going to ruin the hard work of all individuals at the restaurant.

However, in late June mangoes were not on the menu (i bought some from Pipeline road behind the hotel).  The tea was very, very average, not true Darjeeling.  The gym was average.  No trainer ever came near me.  Another hotel in Delhi had a trainer greet and stretch me every day, so I was expecting a bit more.  Could not find yoga mats either.  Probably there, not found..

The setup had to be customized frequently yet he managed to fulfill the requirements. Wishing him good luck in his near future endeavors and hope to visit again.
2146,MING LAI L,2,Disappointed with the service,"I stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai most of the time when I visit Mumbai. Having stayed at Taj Palace, The Westin and ITC Maratha makes me feel that the service in Grand Hyatt is way below them.  The staff at the club lounge is extremely lazy and are talking to themselves most of the time. It‚Äôs faster to get your own coffee than to order it with the staff. I‚Äôve been staying here for two weeks, they never remember what u drink.  But I have to compliment Sarswati of  Fifty Five.  Although I only go to Fifty Five for breakfast on weekends, she remembers  I take espresso for my breakfast.  In summary, Grand Hyatt needs to teach their employees in the Club lounge about service.  Suggest you promote Sarswati to the club lounge to teach the staff there about service."

Upon entering, it was already clear that my stay was going to be memorable -- the front desk staff that assisted me with check-in was pleasant and was able to assign me to a room on a high-floor with garden views (even though the Club floors are on Level 1 and 2 only) due to my status with the World of Hyatt loyalty program. It was also a nice touch to be given a personal tour of the property and shown to my room right after check-in.   The room was reasonably spacious and tastefully designed with wood accents and though the overall property is not that new, it was clear that my room was well maintained. The automatic window blinds was also a wow factor and could easily be controlled‚Ä¶"

The check in process was smooth and room was decent, with the levels expected of a Hyatt property. Wifi was decent and coverage was good, food was average, nothing great. The one sore point was their concierge service. i was told the previous night that a cab had been arranged, but when I went to catch my early morning flight, the concierge on duty then did not see a reservation and I had to book an Ola. That apart the stay was satisfactory."

I was arriving after a long journey from Singapore via Dubai and was only really in need of a bed on arrival around 9 in the morning. Unfortunately my room wasn't quite ready and I was asked to wait in the reception area with a cup of coffee until it was. About 15 minutes later an efficient and pleasant lady confirmed that my room on the second floor was available.   The guy delivering my baggage was very helpful and wanted to show me all the features of the room but I was only really interested in getting some sleep. What I really liked was the big, inviting king sized bed and large black out curtains operated by a switch by the side of the bed. Ideal for sleeping. That morning,‚Ä¶"

These people were very courteous and helpful. Grand Hyatt is a must stay hotel. They have a lovely Sunday brunch buffet which is a must attend spot in Mumbai.

I highly recommend this hotel if you want to have a delightful stay."
2213,Octoberborn_Nomad,5,Deluxe Hotel,I stayed at Grand Hyatt for 2 nights recently in connection with an event which was happening at their Grand Ballroom. The room which I got was spacious with lovely view of Western Express highway and flights taking off from nearby international airport. Staff is courteous & friendly.

2215,Mauidivers,5,A fabulous oasis in such a crazy city!!,"When we first moved to Mumbai we stayed at the Grand Hyatt and it was fantastic! India is an assault on all 5 senses and being at the Hyatt made it all so much easier to cope! The service is excellent from the moment you arrive to housekeeping, spa and the restaurants! I'm a big foodie so we ate at all their restaurants and my recommendations are.... the duck at the China house, any and all of the pasta dishes in Celini even the vegetarian ones and I'm a HUGE meat lover!!! The Sunday brunch in 55 East is a must! The executive chef Jef Foster even stopped by our table and he is incredible! He made my husband and I feel so welcomed, told us about where he sources his produce and his food and the menu options are excellent. It's also conveniently located and only about 10 minutes‚Ä¶"

Enjoyed alot. wish to come there many more times and spend time in Grand Hyatt. Thanks.
2217,Amit J,1,Ridiculous service,I have been a regular guest at the Hyatt properties and am currently staying at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai and the service levels are so poor that I am appalled . I wanted to order room service and checked and did not have a room service menu in my room.. So I called up the room service number and asked them to send a menu to my room.. After waiting for 40 minutes and not getting a menu I called back and was told that we have already informed house keeping and that I should check with them.. I asked that since I requested you why can‚Äôt you help me .. the room service guy says tell me what you want?? I said I need a menu and he said please check with house keeping and put the phone down... It‚Äôs just ridiculous
2218,Nebuliza,4,Decent Business Hotel,"I stayed here on a quick 2 day business trip to Mumbai. Having recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt in New York (a complete train wreck of a hotel) I was a little nervous. I shouldn‚Äôt have worried. The staff and service were excellent. The function rooms were spacious and, save for some sound issues around the microphones for speakers, were perfectly adequate for a business hotel. Whilst the rooms could probably do with a refresh they are spacious and comfortable. The bed in particular was excellent. All in all a decent business hotel conveniently located near the airport. "
2219,Varshaa,4,Good hotel with a crooked entry,"The Grand Hyatt is actually grand cuz it's huge in every respect. But the entrance to the hotel is a bit crooked, possibly due to the construction in the area at the time we visited. Staff is extremely courteous. Rooms are spacious. Breakfast menu is a bit boring and sometimes during conferences you need to queue up to be seated so that's a bit of a let down but overall, the staff and size of rooms with the location make it a good value for money hotel in Mumbai."
2220,Sean V,4,"Grand indeed, a good choice.......","Stayed at Grand Hyatt Mumbai in May 2018  Pros: 1, Proximity to airports. 2, Proximity highway. 3, Proximity to BKC business district. 4, Massive property - grand as the name implies. 5, Incredible breakfast - amazing! 6, Well appointed rooms, decent size. 7, Incredible courtyard - pool - greenery abounds. 8, Rates are incredible for a 5 star property. 9, Lovely works of art all over.  Cons:  Cannot think of any. The Taj and Oberoi properties are a notch above, but then you pay for the difference.  Overall: Very satisfied. Good choice in Bombay."
2221,Rohit S,5,Business Events,This is one of the best place available in the centre of the city to organise a large scale event. It has lots of meeting spaces available to cater to a crowd of 1000 + audience and also have one of the biggest Pre-function area available to you.

2224,Shikhar B,5,Would Want to Come Back...,"I used to visit this property daily for my swimming sessions before I moved out of India. However, my first actual stay happened to me this month when we visited Mumbai for a personal trip. While I had booked the room through a third-party website, there were absolutely no hassles - from check-in to check-out. The staff was great, the service was quick, the property (as I already knew) was very well-maintained. They offered me and my family access to the lounge at some price - an offer I took but cancelled after a few hours (as our little one was not feeling too well and we wanted to stay in the room). That too was hassle-free. We stayed there just for a few hours without spending the night -- as we had an overseas flight to catch -- I'd say that we definitely wanna come back‚Ä¶"

The room was ok, bed comfortable, the food good, if on the very pricy side for India, as were the drinks!! Breakfast was self service and the range good.  There are better choices for about the same money in better areas of the city but for an overnight stay its fine."
2230,hurricanbiker,5,It is a place to feel like home,"This Hotel is one of the best recommendations you can get. It is not only the hospitality and the perfect service of the heedful staff which make your stay enjoyable, it is also the style and design of all the nice bibs and bobs around. Beside the extraordinary china house where you must try the fantastic peking duck you should not miss the 55E. Regardless if you join the incredible breakfast with Indian or international dishes or if you join the dinner buffet with all the mouthwatering goodies. Thanks to the friendly and helpful staff like Mihir, Harpreet or Swapnil you will be very pleased"

2236,Niharika G,2,very very average overpriced food.,"We visited the Celini restaurant at Grand Hyatt, mumbai on saturday may 12th 2018 for dinner. Celini is an italian restaurant here.  We have visited here in the past and I always found the food extremely average, but it is the thought that we are dining at ""Grand Hyatt"" which sort of makes you feel good.  The usher took us inside, and though the restaurant was practically empty, she proceeded to place us at the worst possible spot against a pillar with a tiny table.  I told her I didn't like the table, which seemed to surprise her no end.   This is not a luxurious place, mind you.  But you are looking to fine dining so thought OK, let's get on with it.

2238,Eleonora N,5,Great Stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai,The location of the hotel is very convenient to the airport and BKC. The hotel has variety of restaurants to choose from. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Last but not least the staff is very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend people to stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai. 
2239,ankurg0el,1,Experience,Service at Restaurant was not good // we waited for broadly 45 minutes to get the food and then in between and to get the bill // no one was listening and attending. I would like to avoid this restaurant.
2240,Monika S,5,Great Hospitality by Prathmesh,"Had been to the soma  restaurant a two month back, second time in this year.We had a awesome experience.the food is best in the town.Hopefully the service this time was great especially by Prathmesh.They gave us a wonderful experience, knowledgeable and proactive.

2241,mnkakoo,5,Meeting,A wonderful hotel. Very few hotels understand the nuances of hospitality. Very professional staff. Eager to help and serve.  Amazing food and amenities. Especially the Oriental cuisines served here we're awesome.  Look forward for visiting again.
2242,1968NC,5,Business trip,"Stayed here in November 2017.  The staff are very helpful, room was fantastic, we were given a ground floor with patio access. Unfortunately we shouldn‚Äôt have opened the door as I was bitten very badly by mosquitos. The staff did all they could to help with sprays etc. The breakfast buffet is probably the best breakfast we have ever experienced on our travels.  The menu for eggs etc plus the choices were fantastic.  The swimming pool area was disappointing with no one sat around, although I know this is more a business destination.  "

2244,RocB747,5,Hospitality at its Best!,"My wife and me stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a night to celebrate her birthday. From the time we checked in to the time we checked out the service and attention was impeccable. From bringing a cake for my wife 10 mins after check-in which, Ms. Evelyn and Richa pulled off smoothly to the guy at the pool bar, Shahrukh, to the lady who did our check in and check out at the front desk, unfortunately can't remember her name, and Mihir at Cellini, were all very warm experiences. Something that tells you that the hotel truly cares about your experience and wants to make it a memorable one. Hats off to Evelyn and her team for ensuring great customer service and satisfaction at all points of contact. Will be back there soon."
2245,Arihantjain,2,Un-responsive service,"Traveled to Grand Hyatt for 3 days due to a conference which was happening in the same hotel. The room was nice and spacious. AC works. Gym is decent.  Issues in room: 1. Weigning scale does not work 2. The table lamp was not functional 3. the bed mattress was so soft that it gave me a back ache. So I called the duty manager and asked him to fix. He offered me some free cocktails which I declined. I was hoping the things to get rectified. But barring the table lamp, other two issues persisted.   Other irritants - For lunch the restaurants (except Chinese restaurant) only do buffet. So you really cannot order a light meal unless room service - Reaching in-room dining can take anywhere from 20 seconds to 7 minutes on phone  Food quality in their all day dining restaurant was just‚Ä¶"
2246,RajeshNair007,5,Grand experience at Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"Grand Hyatt is large business hotel , well located and will comfortable plush rooms. The  ambience is best suited for business and business conferences with some great conference facilities. The rooms in the basement provide the ideal atmosphere for business conferences and 'company dos'. Most of the rooms have good views but it will help to enquire and mention your preference of views and get the appropriate room.There is a lot of food options and even the regular Malwani and Mumbai cuisine can be tasted here."
2247,shreemi,5,Grand Hyatt Fitness Center,I am regularly visiting the club house of Grand Hyatt Mumbai and I am being trained by Justin for my fitness. I am really glad to get connected to this amazing club house and their trainers. They are well versed with their job and provide amazing service. Keep up the good work Team.

We were surprised to have the F&B Director Mr Jaymon visit our table and take feedback which is a very rare gesture seen at hotels !!  Mr Joshua did needful well..The guests are pampered by the staff be at the pool or by the head Chef Lii of the restaurant , no wonder this property is best rated as guests are happier as compared to other alternatives available. Manager Imtiaaz and service around the pool SRK were very amiable and enriched our experience.. If you need to experience True Grandness, this hotel is the place to be at !"
2249,prkapkot,5,Great Experience,"Warm welcome, polite and caring staff, Great range of food and good taste. Like the Non-veg Menu specifically the starters. Room is clean and all required belongings are taken care. Front desk staff is prompt and always ready to support."

Where as sometimes I am billed as Interglobe staff and sometimes Airfrance staff which invariably creates confusion resulting in wrongly billing and wastage of time .

2253,PickyglobetrotterUk,4,Another good stay,I stay here a couple of times a year and have been doing so for around 7 years. Good location near airport and western express highway. Professional and friendly staff although rooms staring to show some signs of wear. Club lounge not as good as Westins (shorter hours and less food and drink choice).

Location is convenient for travelers as is it around 15 minutes from both International and Domestic airport .  This hotel is also popular for hosting corporate events. Rooms are comfortable as expected from a five star property.  I have had dinner at  their restaurant China House ,food was good. China House (Lounge)is also one of the premier nightclubs of Mumbai ,has good music and well known artists play there. Also at another official event,their buffet was very good."

The premises, courtyard, restaurants, health club, Pools, Spa everything really world class. Staffs are very courteous. Rooms are well maintained and there was no delay in room service.

2266,Naman Jain,1,Horrible Hotel,"Not at all worth of money they charge. No one cares to welcome the guests when they enter the lobby and in buffet breakfast, veg. food variety was very less and the dishes was same for our 3 day duration stay. Not at all worth for calling this a 5 Star hotel"

He possesses immense knowledge about fitness and will be more than happy to help you out!
2269,Ajay K,1,AVOID LIKE PLAGUE,"Let me list down the issues that I had with my stay :  1) The request for silent room was turned down ( I understand that you hotel might be booked to full capacity ), but for advance requests which have been made atleast you should consider some request and I don't have to haggle for it at 2 am in the midnight.  2) Computer Chair was missing in the room that I got. I had to Call up the front desk at 3 am in the morning to ask for it ? I felt I'm staying in a cheap hotel.  3) Mini-Bar missing from the room ( ROOM no. 2127 ) . Ok , I understand this is not such an important issue, but yes, it becomes VERY DAMN IMPORTANT when you're staying in a Star Hotel. Please don't operate your hotel if you can't keep up with the basic facilities.  4) No Cutlery on the Breakfast Table , No‚Ä¶"
2270,fcpilcher,5,Great pool staff,"Grand Hyatt Mumbai has become a home away from home, partly due to great facilities and location but also due to great, kind staff.    This visit, Shahrukh of the pool team went above and beyond to ensure my requests were met and always provided thoughtful and attentive service.    The front desk and concierge teams are amazing as well, making a visit fraught with the vagaries of business travel easy and achievable.  They provide some of the best top flight service compared to any hotel in Mumbai."

We have been elite member in Marriott for last 20+ years. But this stay in Hyatt has changed our perspective positively. The staff were so good, caring and welcoming at all levels - i.e. Fifty five dining hall or Spa or front desk or anywhere. We were blown away with the quality of food, especially breakfast, they had so much healthy choices starting from fresh juices to all kinds of sprout and awesome variety of food. Our first stay was so good, after 2 days we went back again to stay in Hyatt and the experience was consistently mind blowing in both our stays. We highly recommend anyone visiting from USA for abroad to consider this hotel for the following reason. 1) Excellent customer service 2) Mind blowing tasty and health‚Ä¶"

Two of the women assisting management around the front desk greeted me by name and chatted with me while I waited for work colleagues to arrive in the lobby.   The mall nearby is convenient, and the pizza in the Italian restaurant on the first floor is a favorite.  Club floor worth the additional upgrade."

I would like to extend my gratitude to Priyanka.   Few interesting things that you may consider: 1. shops inside the hotel 2. different special courses are available like cooking classes, swimming lessons, etc. However, you will need to arrange this prior to your visit and get it booked/confirmed.  3. Different restaurants inside the hotel. Plan well to enjoy the exquisite cuisine.   Other suggestion to any foreigners: 1. If you are not using the hotel car to travel, I would strongly recommend using the service of Harkit Singh (+91 81084 07919). No stress and no need to worry of being over-charged. He is a decent person who will assist you fully during your stay.‚Ä¶"

Especially to Deepika Shah, the Guest relationship officer who made my stay extremely comfortable from the booking to departure. I was accompanied by my family too, and it was the same view of opinion by them . She takes every little bit of care to acknowledge the request of the guest and meet it at any cost. Her professionalism is highly commendable. She is truly an asset to Hyatt. I am surely a regular comer to Hyatt with the ambience that she introduced with hospitality. Kudos !!!"

2280,MrPigeon,3,"Very nice hotel, but weird reception experience ruined it","The hotel is all you‚Äôd expect from a property of the type and price bracket.  Rooms were nice, though they did have a weird transparent door separating the toilet from the rest of the bathroom - not sure what the point is, as it provides no privacy (there is a door separating the bathroom from the bedroom, so no worries on that score).   My only problem is that when we arrived, exhausted, from the airport, they insisted that we only had one room booked despite me having paperwork showing clearly that there were two rooms booked, and electronic proof of this too.  They only backed down when I said I was going to go somewhere else - before that they suggested I pay for an extra room on the spot which I was no way going to do (I had pre-paid for two rooms).  Not sure what was‚Ä¶"
2281,238nishantk,4,Quiet affordable due to its proximity to the airport,A nice hotel near the airport. If you are visiting for the weekend or short trip better to stay this side of the town. Rooms are quiet big and you have an option to choose a smoking room. Room service is 24/7.
2282,Navtej G,4,Good location - Busy and Central,Central hotel for Mumbai. The hotel is modern and light with good sized rooms. The club facilities are excellent and the service was very good. The hotel is busy and there are a lot of functions taking place. Not for a quiet break but a good place for a break with friends or a city visit.

But the check-in experience could have been better. Also, most of the times my call from the room to guest service was never answered in the first go, it actually took atleast for me to call 3-4 times. "

The hotel is like a big cruise ship,We stayed here for 3 nights.  ‚úÖ fantastic staff - friendly and will try to accommodate all needs  ‚úÖ concierge service was outstanding and happy to help with all our request.  Infact I would say they go beyond the call of duty.  ‚úÖ front desk staff were awesome.  They provided us a business card so we can call them when ever. They got us out of a jam or two.  I wish I could recall the chaps name who we contacted so many times.  He was simply awesome  ‚úÖ good location for shopping in Santa Cruz ‚úÖ ok the room we felt was a little small as I was expecting something slightly larger but it is a city hotel I suppose.  ‚úÖ Super breakfast ‚úÖ decent spa ‚úÖ it‚Äôs a huge hotel - normally I‚Äôm not a fan of  huge hotels but didn‚Äôt mind so much after as the staff are a credit to the Hyatt brand 
2291,Sherman H,4,Good Hotel,"Was here for a conference. Have been coming to this hotel since it opened on and off. As in Mumbai, I always pick a hotel which is close to where I need to go.  Physically the hotel has challenges. The breakfast restaurant is too small. There is a huge staircase for you to lug your bag up. And down. However they make it work. Staff all over and while some of the women standing around I am not clear what they do except get in the way, the rest of the staff make sure you are comfortable.   The rooms are of a good size and as it is off the main road, it is quiet at night and hence you get a good night sleep.  For me the way to tell if a hotel is good or not is if i will come back and in this case, I certainly will."
2292,Bhavesh M,4,Great hotel with amazing amenities and just perfect for families with kids,"I stayed at thr apartment at the hotel, which is part of their residences offering. The room was spacious with a small kitchnette and the facilities in general are excellent. One does feel the age of the hotel but the kids still enjoyed the stay. Their pool is really nice and the indoor kids play area is a good relief if you want the kids to be busy for a short while. The restaurants are really good and thr staff are extremely friendly and helpful."
2293,Krishna S,5,Club Oasis Fitness Centre,"I went down to the fitness centre and approached a trainer there, Mr Sachin. He is a very humble and a professional trainer who is passionate about his work. He took out a great deal of his time to explain, in great detail about the various components of fitness and most importantly nutrition. All whilst, managing to welcome the other guests with a very warm hospitality. Looking forward to many more workouts with this great man.   -Krishna. "
2294,Ezy H,4,Turnaround in opinion,When I visited this hotel in October 2017 I was unimpressed and a bit let down. After that I stayed in other hotels when I visited Mumbai. However my opinion was completely changed when I stayed here again in March 2018. The big change was the approach of the customer service representatives who greet you on entry at lobby level and cater to all your requests. In particular Jhanvi was of immense help and one of the reasons I would return to this hotel again. Of course the location is good and the restaurants are pretty decent. The reopening of the China garden lounge is also another reason to stay here.

2296,RMaha,5,The best hotel experience I have ever had,"Our stay at the Grand Hyatt was the best hotel experience I have ever had. The staff was so attentive and courteous and they made our stay beyond amazing. From checking in, Yash took the time to sit down with us and mark 'must see' places in Mumbai on a map, and talk us through areas that would be good for shopping etc. At the breakfast buffet, the servers were very obliging, to the point where when my mother asked Swapnil how a certain Indian dish she had heard about was made, he communicated this to Chef Chandanchand who actually made the dish for her the next morning. The servers, like Amit, took the time to answer all our questions about Indian cuisine, and even brought us samples of spices we were curious about.

We must have had 10 bottles per day  Negatives: Better sound proofing of rooms.also the corridors at all levels are open between each other so sound travels up and down There seems to be no room to store bags if you are travelling late.

The gym is very well equipped and instructors like Justin in grand Hyatt is very few of them . Justin helped me improve my gym routine and guide me through entire  fitness routine . Kudos to him !!  Next visit you should look for him in the gym next time you visit !!
2305,CamelGurgaon,5,Business trip,"For various reasons, we stayed in 3 top hotels in Mumbai this week. The Grand Hyatt was by far the best in nearly every aspect. From the warm welcome to the caring farewell, we were treated like honoured guests and family.  The lounge was especially pleasant and relaxing with fantastic service. The staff were outstanding and I would like to give special mention to Priyanka (check-in) Astha (customer service), all the staff from the Grand Club (Vishal, Om, Vincent and Chef Ankita) and Bell Service Anant, who waited patiently with us and found the taxi when it eventually arrived on a very busy forecourt."

2309,Andrew S,5,Great Service!,"I have visited the Grand Hyatt Mumbai every six months for the past several years and I consistently receive excellent service.  The hotel is conveniently located (~45 minutes drive in the morning to Powai) and the facility is in excellent condition.  The selection of restaurants is excellent and the breakfast buffet is great.  I'd like to note one exceptional service experience I had on my last trip.  I put laundry in on Sunday morning.  I received a message a short while later that they had noted a tear in a shirt.  They came to my room to show me and offered to mend it.  I had a small seam tear in a pair of pants that I was about to try to mend myself, but when I showed it to the gentleman from the laundry department, he offered to fix it.  For me, this was really taking care‚Ä¶"

My school mate was staying there and hence we decided to drop by. Good food prep by the Chef when we wanted to eat a small Dinner without moving out from the Bar.  Good.

2317,oskarrosarius,5,Great hotel - fantastic staff,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 days. Everything is as what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. In particular, the pool and spa area is extraordinary. The facilities are great, but the staff made the stay even more special. Shahrukh and Suryakant from the pool area made our stay a wonderful experience. Very welcoming, friendly and attentive. This kind of service is rare and makes the Grand Hyatt my first choice in Mumbai. 5 star hotels don‚Äôt differentiate itself through their facilities a lot but what makes a great stay a fantastic stay is the staff. Thank you for the great time and hospitality. Shahrukh and Suryakant your truly breath hospitality and understand how to take care of your guest and make sure that the values of the brand is actually delivered on the work floor.‚Ä¶"

2321,mahadevarun,5,Simply the best business hotel in Mumbai,"I'm staying here for 4 days for the FICCI FRAMES Film & TV market and I have to say every aspect of my stay so far has been an absolute pleasure. The staff are friendly without being intrusive, service is always with a smile and you are remembered and appreciated as a guest., All of this is happening at a time when the hotel and its facilities are at full stretch for the biggest film and TV event in Asia. There is no let up in attention to detail, to care and above all to listening to what a guest says. Having stated in five star luxury hotels all over the world I have to say that this is one of the best experiences I have had. The guys by the pool and at breakfast are especially friendly and deserve a special mention. Highly recommended."
2322,Dinesh S,5,Hotel staff and gym facility,"I always prefer to stay in Grand Hyatt as the hotel staff is very friendly and understanding. I want to highlight the gym experience where their staff member (Gym Trainer) Justin shared incredible knowledge about workout, diet, posture and helped me gain a lot of insight. His knowledge about human body, gym, various exercises etc. is phenomenal and I appreciate his kind gesture towards the guest."
2323,Arsheen,5,Pool area,Stayed at grand Hyatt mumbai this month for a business event I was attending (FICCI FRAMES) . The first thing that caught my attention was the beautiful pool area the property has. After a long gruelling day all I could think about was taking a dip in that pool and enjoying a beer with my colleague. We reached at 8 pm poolside and got to know the bar is closed. But thanks to @sharukh and @audesh the managers of the area . They made sure we got our beer which completed my Hyatt experience at a high! Thanks guys :)

2325,sottogirl,5,Beautiful Hotel but do not make an overseas call to your bank.  It will cost you a fortune.,"We recently spent 11 nights at this hotel.  The rooms are lovely, staff very friendly.  Housekeeping were fabulous. Breakfast was amazing.  One fault was that my husband had to make a call to our banking concierge at the ANZ bank in Australia and the duration of the call was 22 minutes.   The charge for the call was over $120 AUD.  We were very disappointed that the charges were ridiculously high.  I will contact the Grand Hyatt to see why the charges were so exorbitant.  My second complaint was that the staff out the front were deliberately trying to rip people off with the use of taxis.  We were leaving for the airport and the guys out the front said unfortunately the taxi drivers would not use a meter and it had to be a fixed rate of 470 Rupee. We could see them passing money‚Ä¶"

2327,Neeraj G,5,Wonderful,"We stayed at the residence, 2 bedrooms and 2 Bath. Clean and spacious, but not cheap~450/night.  24 hour room service and fitness center were great. Breakfast there is tops with fresh fruit, cappuccino, made to order dishes as well. Had egg white omelettes daily. The pool is adequate with slow food and drink service there, around 3/4 hour between order and food delivery. The bar inside had everything but was overpriced. (12 dollars for a weak rum and coke). Cigarettes were 8 dollars a pack. It's the Hyatt so I understand.  Guest relations were also great. They addressed my 8 yo son and gave him special attention with fine chocolates delivered for him to our room.  We also had access to the lounge which was great for an afternoon coffee and bottled water. Their happy hour 6-8 had‚Ä¶"

2330,Charles W,5,"5 star, with facilities and service to match","Modern 5 star hotel with very large, well appointed rooms. Location close to airport, though long way from tourist areas. Quiet central pool area. Excellent restaurants - try the Chinese one. High ratio of staff (well trained, friendly and helpful) to guests."
2331,Ariff B,5,Fitness center,"Superb service and guidance by Justin at the gym. Experienced and in selfish help! One of the most insightful and keen trainers I have met  Great facilities at the hotel. Good, spacious rooms and decent bouquet of restaurants."
2332,drwightchef,5,Great Stay,"I arrived at the GH for a wedding and my overall stay was impeccable. The property itself is nice, clean and spacious. The food in all of the restaurants was top notch. The concierge tented to all the guests every need and I was very impressed with how far they went out of their way to make us happy. The spa is also worth a visit. The only downside is the neighborhood. If you feel like venturing out on food be prepared, this is the real deal. A very poor and dense area, no regard for pedestrians and lots of traffic. That being said if you can deal with that there is a liquor store around the corner, ATMs, fruit stands and lots of small shops."
2333,Kalpana P,4,"Much Improved, Happier Hyatt","I last stayed at the Grand Hyatt in 2015 and was less than impressed with my stay and experience.  Everyone I came across seemed miserable and uninterested in their guests or service. It was a clean yet cold place to stay.   I decided to give it another chance and I‚Äôm glad I did.   NEGATIVES: I was offered an early check in as a Hyatt member via email which I accepted, it wasn‚Äôt free, there would be a charge of 5,000 rupees. On the day of check in, I hadn‚Äôt heard anything so called the Hotel directly to check, only to discover, they had zero knowledge about my early check in. I had to rearrange meetings and my whole afternoon; at that point I thought I‚Äôd made a huge mistake in trusting the Hyatt with my stay.  A day after I arrived at the Hotel, I was offered an apology by two‚Ä¶"
2334,Frank Groenen,5,Nice support in the gym!,Gym is open 24/7. Good equipment!  Sachin is the instructor who helped me in a very friendly and stimulating fashion during my workout. Thanks.   The hotel is very convenient located. I use the hotel for my business trips while in Mumbai.   The hotel has great restaurants specially the Chinese and the Italian restaurant are great. 
2335,Aditya P,5,Impressive trainer in the gym,"This review is specifically for Mr Sachin Surve, who is the trainer in the gym.  As my work takes me to a lot of hotels, and I end up using the gym every single time. But today at the gym, I got the opportunity to have a word with Mr Sachin, and I was really amazed - with the knowledge, the direction, and the manner in which he told me about various aspects of workout and proper eating habits. He is very modest and humble at the same time very much direct to the point. I appreciate that.  He offered me a great deal of information about the rights and wrongs I was doing and helped me realise the process of working out from a more professional point of view. Indeed a very spectacular workout session for the body and mind.  Keep up the good work! "
2336,MEL455,4,Very Good Stays,"We stayed here two times - once before and once after a cruise.  The rooms are large comfortable and very clean.  The staff is well trained and helpful.  We were surprised that some of them remembered us on our second stay.  The breakfast was very good, excellent choices.  The first room had a balcony that we really did not like because it cut out most of the light into the room and there is too much pollution to use it.  The second room had much more light.  We ate in the China House and the main restaurant and found both were very good.  Our only compliant was that we booked this hotel thru Igloo.com in London and was provided with confirmation numbers for both stays at the same time.  We had no problem with the first stay but when we checked in for the second stay, the hotel‚Ä¶"
2337,Dalia M,1,Terrible and unprofessional staff and service,"We booked at Grand Hyatt mumbai for one night and we booked a meeting room for 2 hours which costs us 150$ and we asked for wifi which is chargeable. you will be shocked that you can only use the wifi for one device (taking into consideration we didn't consume our MB) and we asked for another username and password to be used for the IPAD and they said it has to be chargeable. Terrible service, terrible snooty staff who don't care a damn about their customers. Insensitive staff behavior."
2338,Sampath G,3,Its a average hotel in Mumbai,We staid 3 nights for business conference. Huge hotel and big rooms. But not maintain properly. Interior looks old. But good room service and front office service.  Also superb service at lobby bar and we really enjoyed. Breakfast had many varieties including Indian food. Enjoyed Masala tea. Even though its a 5 star property man areas ignored. Staff friendly and attentive.Overall its good stay.
2339,Sumit Kapoor,4,Overall a good stay !,Overall a good stay . The ground staff at the entry though are not very attentive and courteous.

The positives: 1) Location - Close Proximity to BKC, Bandra and south Mumbai compared to other airport hotels 2) People other than at the front desk seem very nice and helpful  - The F&B, housekeepers, etc. are great.  I inquired about what was going on in the restaurant and the manager gave me an impromptu invitation to what  turned out to be a very nice wine tasting dinner. - I was walking around frustrated and looking lost because the pool area was closed when a manager noticed and showed me to another outdoor area and made sure I was comfortable and had what I needed  - At breakfast the service was spot on and friendly - If I call downstairs for something,‚Ä¶"

2345,Jitesh P,5,Great hotel,"The room was spacious and the staff were very welcoming. We were a family of 3 and needed a cot, the staff were very quick to bring the cot up and allowed us to put our child to sleep on time. The service to heat her food up in the kitchen via room service was very good on most occasions. Rooms were clean and cleaned thoroughly. The pool was very good as was the Jacuzzi."
2346,Bruno D,5,comfort!!,"Was there feb 9 - 10th a weekend.  Hotel is wonderful, great service and staff. BUT there was a big wedding over the weekend and then was very noisy because kids were running and screaming in floors and adults talking to each other with room dors opened !! Hotel reception should place families and people coming in for such parties in one aisle of the hotel and on one floor."

2349,Kirti Panchal,4,Date night with my Husband on Valentines Day,"China House Lounge is one of our favourite Chinese Restuarants in the city and thus we chose to celebrate Valentine's Day by going for dinner! When I called to book a seat, the said person offered me a Valentine's package of Rs.6000 per couple which had a six course meal.   To our disappointment, the meals weren't unlimited and the portions were really small even for me as a lady! The service was very slow that night and the food was not that great unlike all our previous experiences there,   The desserts were surprisingly great and we were offered two portions, I guess because the staff noticed that we were still hungry!   All in all, we love the place but would recommend not to go for any packages. Just stick to the normal ala-carte menus!"

I have to stay in this hotel from time to time as my office books us in this hotel whenever we come to mumbai as this is quite close to our office. I have stayed here atleast 25-30 times, amounting to atleast a cumulative stay of over 8-10 months over the past 5 years so this review is not based on a one time visit but visits over the past 5 years. The staff is possibly the worst i have ever seen in any hotel. They are rude (especially the front office) and think they are doing you a  favour by giving you a room. They have botched up our reservations even after i received confirmations over email, they routinely forget what is covered in your room package.

I called the housekeeping department afterward and asked for their policy on changing the beddings.

When I asked he why they did not changes my beddings, he started to say something like if the bedding is not dirty, they will try to reuse them.

I like the chinese Restuarant within the hotel as they serve very original chinese dishes.  Highly recommended for those whom want stay here for the Hyatt branding ! "

Had to call reception to tell them to stop disturbing us.

2363,Sujith S,4,Amazing short stay,"The hotel is in great location with easy access to lots of prominent places. The only thing that can worry you is the traffic. The hotel staff are very attentive. Even though the airport pick up was missed, that was offset by an early check-in. The lady at the reception was prompt and courteous (I guess her name is Deepa ). The food is good but I think a bit expensive when compared to other places. Has a shopping arcade which almost provides everything."

Love the quality of service and the variety of flavours that they offer! We were surprised to see a cake being arranged for my Dad after they found out that it was his birthday. In Soma, We tried the non veg platter which had lip smacking varieties of chicken, mutton and fish delicacies. For the main course we ordered the chicken dum biryani which was well done with subtle flavours. Would definitely go there again! Thanks Rodney and Ritesh for being such great hosts üòä"

2393,Beniamin007,5,Opulence! This is a beautiful hotel with very charming and wonderful staff. They are really friendly and helpful.,"My room booking included breakfast which was sumptuous. There were lots of different cuisines offered including English, Asian including North Indian, South Indian. Pastries and all sorts of patisseries, fruits were also available. Very good service. The downside was that the restaurants prices at the hotel were very high for other meals. "
2394,JATIN,3,OUR 6 NIGHT STAY AT THIS HOTEL,"The first thing I want to alert all travellers is that this hotel is actually situated in Santa Cruz EAST and not Bandra as most travel websites will have you believe ,including , the one I booked with . The biggest disadvantage of this is that Santa Cruz East is NOT as popular an area as Santa Cruz West and to get a rickshaw or a Taxi to bring you back to the hotel in the evening is not an easy process! Secondly  and notwithstanding the opulence of the hotel itself ,the location is not ideal as traffic is unrelenting not to mention the air pollution as it is situated directly off the western expressway . The hotel itself is grand with a number of fine restaurants to choose from and the service impeccable as is the case in most 5 star Indian hotels . The pool is situated‚Ä¶"
2395,Chantman,3,Needs to get its act together,"After 24 hours of travel,we arrived exhausted at the Hyatt around 1145pm. All 4 reservation desks were busy, and we were escorted to another one on the next floor. Having paid for a King Size bed in advance, we were surprised to hear the question "" will twin beds be ok?"". I explained they would not be ok, and asked for the room we had paid for. Twenty minutes passed while the guy at the desk fumbled around trying to find a room. He told us that the hotel was heavily booked. At this stage, I lost it and told him it wasn't good enough, and we wanted to go to our room to sleep right now. We left the reception area, and sat down in some comfortable seats nearby. An assistant manager type appeared and offered us a suite ! Obviously they were desperate.   Why is it that you can pay in‚Ä¶"
2396,Sakthi1996,5,Great for conferences,"I was here in the first week of January attending a medical conference with a live workshop beamed from a hospital 17 kilometers away. Grand Hyatt is quite near to the airport and one can escape the traffic of Mumbai while getting back home from Mumbai. The reception is good, rooms are good, beds and bed linen is good. I liked the restaurant and the breakfast spread. And to top it all i really liked the large conference hall where the conference was conducted. It was spacious with good ambiance.  Shall recommend it to anyone who want to feel at home while in Mumbai and escape from the city with least trouble while heading back home."
2397,garysg99,5,Great hotel at decent value!,"One of the grander and bigger hotels around the airport area. Location wise it is good and the staff generally is nice and friendly. I arrived late in the night and had some issue with my card however Ms. Shruti at the check in counter was very helpful. The rooms, gym and pool area are nice and up to the Grand Hyatt standards. This time however the hotel seemed to be very crowded during my stay and there was always a queue during the breakfast hours due to which even the restaurant staff looked quite hassled, so I guess it is better to go slightly earlier (before 8.30-9), if one is in a rush. Another sore point was the gym equipment/area being hogged by an external PT and his clients. I understand it might be a common practice in a lot of 5 star hotels in India, however still‚Ä¶"
2398,Lara B,5,Amazing stay for business,The food at this hotel is so amazing. I have stayed twice and the breakfast is really good- lots of authentic Indian food to try and not have to worry if you'll get sick and also amazing fruit and pastries.  The Italian restaurant also has the best mushroom pasta I've ever had and the other restaurant has the best Peking duck- cut up right at your table.

2406,Riya C,2,So many Things out of place,"This was a last minute booking. Booked for a king size room got a queen instead. The AC isn't great. The staff (at least the ones I dealt with) are really cold and unwelcoming. The person before me got a staff escort her to her room but I had no one to escort me. Asked to fill the mini bar thrice but wasn't filled till the time i checked out. The food however was a savior. At the time of check out, I was asked how was the stay and I said it was terrible but nothing was done to change or at least better my experience a tad bit. There are way better hotels in Mumbai at the same price or less that are welcoming, give you good service and are polite, This hotel is definitely not one of them."
2407,918deepab,5,Nice stay!!,"Over all i had good stay, staff is polite. Clean. Near to airport. Few minor points wanted to highlight.   Room service was slow: When i called for the room service, the night we arrived. It took almost 10 mins ( forever) to place the order. The call was answered very late.  The bathtub in the room 6141 had black spots. Might not be there in every room. I didn‚Äôt feel like stepping inside. Needs maintenance/replacement.  There was no sign for gym. Even in the lift it is indicated club house/ pool etc. But its not clearly mentioned that there is a gym. I had to ask around.  "

Both individuals were exemplary, and a pleasure to deal with."

Breakfast variety is Great and the staff was kind enough to pack bfast since I was almost short of time in leaving for work. Location is great if you are working in BKC and is also close to the airport However one thing I felt missing for personalizing things - I've stayed in Taj and ITC for long time and the staff takes extra care of business travelers who stay away from home for long duration. Other than that.. Great place. "
2410,drrganesh,3,Average!,"Visited this hotel as part of a conference. Access roads are terrible as the hotel is located slightly away from the main road. Check In- no issues. Fast and courteous.  Rooms- small. No view to talk about. In my case had to wrestle many times to get the door open. Issues with phone/ TV not working; though they were addressed quickly.  Food- Average.  All in all, good for a short business trip. "

We were there for the new year celebration and obviously it was perhaps sold out or at least claimed, however that doesn't mean getting rude welcome. We were waiting in front of front desk for check in and there were pilots around as well for check in. Receptionist told that us she would first check in the ""Captains"" then us, although it was clearly our turn. If the property wants to cater to ""Captains"" only then keep close it for common people like us. When I raised the issue, we were taken care of by another executive, he also apologized on that lady's behalf.

2416,Jo T,4,Good hotel but a lot of hassle with paying! 20 mins from airport,We booked this hotel because it was supposed to be very near the airport and it was simply a stopover after an internal flight before our flight home to London.  We had a lot of trouble with payment when booking. They took our money a few times and we had hassle getting it back (all sorted in the end). The shower was pretty poor. Powdered Nescaf√© (or tea) only in the room. We were a family of 6 people and we were put on three different floors. We didn‚Äôt mind that much until we realised that our room keys only allowed us to get out on our own floor so if we wanted to give something to one of the others we had to arrange to meet them in reception. As we were sorting out packing for the return that was a bit frustrating. This is India! It was advertised as 10 minutes from the‚Ä¶

My experience became even more worthwhile as my interaction with Mr.Justin at the fitness centre gave me tips on fitness which will help me in my fitness goal.He was also very courteous.

The lobby even has club music blaring all day. The noise pollution level of the hotel is really high. Corridors to the guest rooms had mattresses stacked against the walls that remained for the whole day. Staff were generally inattentive and seemed stressed by the full house. Service was best at the club lounge, and the food and wine were good, but this was all still a far cry from the level of service and F&B for example, at the Grand Hyatt Goa. And this is coming from a Hyatt fan (World of Hyatt Explorist)."

Paid as much for the rooms as I would in any Western city so expected same level of service and comfort.  Check in very slow and required more staff on but staff all very friendly and pleasant in all contact.  Had arranged extra beds in booking and subsequent email but these had not been added and had to wait another hour after a close to midnight arrival from Australia.

I spent the New Years eve at the hotel and it was a splendid affair. It is a magnificent affair."
2448,Neil G,3,Nice hotel but some unresolved issues remain,Nice hotel with everything you would expect from a five star establishment. It is undoubtedly pricey relative to India (almost ¬£100 for laundering 16 items of clothing) but that's to be expected.  What's annoying and remains an outstanding issue is the hotel bills in your home country currency and therefore applies it's own exchange rate. That rate is considerably worse than the market rate and this only becomes apparent after you've left - there is no mention at checkout. I find this underhand. Have asked for this to be corrected and two weeks on am still waiting for a response from the hotel.

2462,gobichettipalayamj,4,Happy stay and a well maintained hotel,The room was always maintained to my preference. Would have loved a better pillow though. Food orders were made to my preference. Outlet staffs need to be a bit more aware of other outlets in terms of timings and food being served. I had to run around all the outlets looking for a late breakfast and none were aware of where I can get breakfast(something from the all day breakfast menu). Finally i got it at the lobby lounge where i asked for it in the first place.
2463,Experience745545,5,Excellent Gym facilities and great hotel,Fantastic hotel with excellent Gym facilities. Justin was a great help in maintaining my fitness during my stay. His personal training sessions are highly recommended. Celini and China House lounge are definitely worth a visit if you a couple of hours spare. 
2464,Shivam Awasthi,4,Comfortable stay,I have visited Hyaat Hotel in November 2017. The hotel is located in Santacruz.  The property is excellent and further supported by trained staff.

2467,359vikramr,4,Service appreciation,"We often stay at this Location due to the fact our Airline company puts us up here. On this particular occasion (23/12/17)  the check-in was handled by Ms.Priyanka from the front desk. After a midnight wakeup prior to coming and a long weary day, the enthusiasm, brightness and genuine sincerity shown by her almost made half the tiredness just melt away. Employees like this add a touch of finesse and lustre to an already established organisation in the field of hospitality. "
2468,A_Saikia_in_Newbury,5,Top Class !!!,"the place lives true to its name- Grand!!! Everything is special about it --the large lobby,  utra spacious rooms with desks, en-suites with a tub & a closet and the arcade at the back of the hotel. The breakfast had good variety as well.  There are lots of events going on especially on weekend and you can expect to see celebrities if you hand around the  cafe at the lobby. The location is a bit odd though. However when you have OLAs and Ubers why do you need a city centre location anyway !!!"
2469,Anant Bhide,5,Luxurious Weekend,Well appointed spacious rooms with modern amenities - a touch of class in everything. The executive lounge was an added attraction for relaxing time with the family. Hotel offered a very wide choice of restaurants - its a pity that one could not do justice during the short stay. Certainly a place to revisit in future.
2470,Prerana Lang,5,Class in itself,Grand Hyatt Mumbai fitness centre is very good. Trainer Justin is always helpful and knows correct techniques for workouts.

I had even used the SPA services ,the staff and the manager are very hospitable & courteous and the masseur Nazma Shaikh who attended me was excellent in her job and the ambience in the room was quite relaxing and so had a very relaxing SPA experience. One must definitely use the steam bath and SPA services. "
2472,BeingNomad,1,Over-hyped & pathetic hotel,"I stayed here for 3 weeks for work as none of the hotels around BKC were available due to some exhibitions. these 3 weeks turned out to be a nightmare at this hotel  What I liked: Rooms are spacious only if you get the right one at check in, breakfast and dinners were superb  What i did not like: Poor sleep quality as beds are a bit worn out, AC switch was broken, poor TV quality  What was disastrous: If you call concierge to get a cab best of luck if the call gets picked up, at times we had to wait for 45-60 minutes to get a cab and ended up booking Uber/Ola, staff is totally non-responsive to your needs, reception told me i have lounge access and when i went to lounge they said i donot have access to it, laundry is very badly done and when asked to press again they asked to‚Ä¶"

The hotel is also quite non-intrusive and gives you space without undue knocks on your door.   I only had breakfast in the kitchen and the variety is just too huge for a small eater like me. I wish they also had some quick breakfast options for a person in a hurry :)"

Room service was tardy. The physical appearance of the hotel interiors was also sub optimal. Might not stay there again as far as I can see. Wonder what's going on there, considering they are not going cheap."

The were up to the mark for providing us with all necessary fixtures and equipment and they were very prompt in their service.  The snacks they offered had good variety and taste, however the buffet lunch needs little attention as it was monotonous every day. It was all same. Their dessert counter had nice variety though.  Staff were very courteous and attentive, they strived to ensure we have a comfortable experience and they were able to achieve the same.  Overall a very good hotel."

2491,Lars B H,4,"Not inexpensive, but what a place the executive club is !","I travel alone and most of the time try to secure a room on the club floor - it's far better to take drinks and snacks in the company of other businesstravellers (many of whom are travelling alone, too). I had apparently stayed at the hotel earlier (at least my name was in their archives) but it must be a long time ago ! The hotel is close to the airport and in the Bandra Kurla area, where most of the big banks are, and convenient for my purpose. The piece de resitance during my stay was the executive club, with a food selection in the evening second to none, and easily a great substitute for dinner. On Sunday evening they even had a bartender, Ivan, mixing daiquiries. Not cheap rooms, by any standards, but sufficient value for money !"

2500,SaidahJules,3,Average hotel but popular one!,"Grand Hyatt is located on highway in Mumbai. It‚Äôs very popular hotel among Mumbaikars for weddings, meetings and dinners.   Location - good location. It‚Äôs not far from airport, on highway, so you can go to any side of Mumbai with same distance if it‚Äôs your concern. Bandra is 10 mins away as well. (Of cause you need a car).   Restaurants - there is famous restaurant and night club China House in it. China House is good for dinner as well.   Breakfast - quite bad to be honest. Small variety of food for 5* hotel. Mostly Indian.   Food - food is very ordinary in room dining. Lets say nothing wrong with it but it‚Äôs not 5* hotel food. I rather eat in trendy restaurants in Bandra.   Rooms - Service apartments rooms feel old and extremely simple (some furniture had stains). Normal rooms‚Ä¶"

2504,rishinicolai,2,"An amazing property, high standards, poor experience","Being a Grand Hyatt property, you would expect nothing but the best from the property. To be honest, this one was even better than I expected. The staff were friendly and the rooms were great. Having said that, my first night there, there was work going on till about 3 in the morning, which was making it very difficult for me to sleep (and I had to get up at 6 in the morning the next day). I had to make a number of calls to the duty manager before they stopped the work. I really expected better from the Hyatt."
2505,Todd S,5,Impressed with their attention to my wife's dietary restrictions,"My wife is both gluten and dairy free and all the restaurants went above and beyond to make sure her meals were great.  They even went as far as making her special meals, with special sauces.  We stay in a lot of 5 star hotels and this was our best dining experience."
2506,Babsinetta,5,Great Italian restaurant,my review is way over due. I had the brunch in this restaurant. The food is one of the best I have had. There was so much variety. Everything was so so so good.The pizza was excellent. My fave was the tiramisu which was very delicious. The staff and chef were friendly and professional.
2507,NAVEEN M,4,Nice hotel with good ambience but no bolt in bathroom of guest room,Visited Hotel for business purpose.  Hotel is good and ambience peaceful.    I found one thing odd.  One can‚Äôt bolt the Washroom door from inside in guest room as there is no bolt / latch provision.   Food was good.

2511,Chris V,2,Good on the surface ....poor on the service and facilities,"Generally a good hotel, but often services and facilities are not working. E.g. like the internet connection and the kitchen (was told that .....after I asked, that the kitchen could not serve hot food as the induction did not work)."
2512,Anil Y,5,The Grand Host.,I like this Hotel and it‚Äôs staff for its professionalism of exemplary order. Staff is ever great in its approach. Hotel is best in comfort and food is exceptional. Pool is great & it has a nice Gym. Great stay each time & every time

After 3 days of being tied down to our exhibit, i finally had a chance to get outside during daylight hours. The pool area was nice with a cabanna to have a nice cold beer. The cabanna boy Srk was very friendly and was doing a great job of trying to keep the swarm of blackbirds away from the pool area."
2514,Prasanth Poduval,4,General Manager,"Stayed at this property on a business trip from 29th Nov to 1st Dec. Excellent fitness centre. Mr. Justin, the fitness guide was extremely helpful. More variety of continental dishes to be included in buffet dinner. Both nights - the food selection was nearly the same. Thai food was given prominence. The dessert spread was superb.  Variety of dishes at breakfast also needs improvement.  Standard dishes like wedges, beans, grilled tomatoes, sausages etc are served. Rooms are quite good. More channels on TV need to be added."

Hotel is quite run down in some areas (bathroom and pool area), rates are ridiculous at some times, food and room size are average. Overall you better stay at the Taj, Hilton or Hyatt Regency"
2517,phizzical,2,A sleepless night,"I have stayed at this hotel several times during my visits to India - I have rarely had a cause of complaint. This time, however, was different. My booking explicitly stated 'quiet room preferred'. When you spend approx ¬£300 on a room, you expect to get a good nights sleep. I was given Room 3117, an outward facing room on the 3rd floor. From around 3am to 6am, all I heard were flights taking off or landing. Additionally, the next room's mobile phone was set to vibrate. So every few minutes, I also heard the mobile's vibrating sound. These sounds become amplified when you are woken abruptly, and left me severely agitated all day. With less an two hours before I was to check out, an offer to change rooms was really not of any interest to me. The staff should have paid better‚Ä¶"
2518,jacquelinebO5243OI,5,Great staff,"Staff are extremely fast and helpful, at my room, at the business center, at the buffet breakfast, at the spa, at the taxi stand at the hotel's gate.. When I first arrived I was surprised that there was no one to take my bags when I got out of the hired car. All of the pool is quite shallow, and thus good for  little kids but not good if you like exercising by walking in chest-deep water."
2519,Yash Mehta,5,Soma dinner,We had dinner at soma the Indian restaurant.  Loved the food and d ambiance. To compliment it all the manager of soma Mr Rodney was ever helpful and knowledgeable and suggested us the best Parsi food.  Kudos to Rodney and his team.
2520,Carcentina,2,Not Grand Hyatt Standard,"I spent three nights in this Hotel and must be honest...............the impression is of a ""tired and dated"" property............far away from world-wide Grand Hyatt standard:  Room: I had a club floor room that was very impractical and small for the class of hotel, cabinet was  placed in the bathroom with space just for a suit and a shirt...(!!) for the class and price of the hotel in 2017 you expect more.  Club Liunge: pretty large , not bad but with a very poor service especially out of breakfast and aperitive hours.......would appreciate something more than coke can, water and coffe. also night buffet is not of adeguate quality to the rank of the Hotel.  Fitness center and SPA: gym is fine but SPA area with Steam bath/Sauna and Jacuzzi need to be refurbished at the‚Ä¶"
2521,sara0084,1,Extremely disappointing experience,"To be honest I was expecting much more from a 5 star hotel. I travelled here for business. Room was ok but not impressive. Swimming pool was full of crows wandering around and going inside the water. Staff at the gym facilities were extremely rude. I tried to make a formal complain about it, but couldn't even talk to the manager. He was very busy apparently. They don't have a complain form and didn't seem very interested in listening either. Again, not the service you expect from a 5 star hotel.  There are plenty of better hotels in Mumbai, I travel there often for business and I can assure you I won't be staying again at Grand Hyatt. "

Our family also thoroughly enjoyed the kids and adult pool and hot tub. "

Good security check and the do a good work.  Take your time and felling the good swimming pool and relax in the spa.  They have a great sauna.  So the hotel is not in a crowd area, if you want to go somewhere you have to grab a taxi.  But it you like to relax it's a great place.  I only have one thing, I get the room on and it's place on the front at the hotel.  You can hear some cars ""horns"" on the morning.  But you can't expect to visit Mumbai and not hear it...  Yes I love to sleep some more time and have the great breakfast. Then relaxing in pool area. "
2525,Jay S,5,Club oasis spa,"Been visiting the spa and gym at club oasis for the past few years. The facility is extremely well maintained and the staff is impeccable.

The wet area is very efficiently maintained by Chandrakant and Milind.  The huge spaces and well equipped gym are some of the reasons I chose this gym, and with the superior quality of service extended to me by the staff, I would definitely be offering my patronage to them for a long time in the future. Good job team club oasis!"

Lots of space, great lighting, and bathroom area is separate from the bed and sitting area, which as a big plus in my books.  Check-in and check-out was smooth.  Soma restaurant serves great Indian food and breakfast buffet on lower level was excellent.  Only complaint was very slow service on both occasions that I visited the lobby bar/restaurant.  Also, it should be noted that this hotel is about half an hour by taxi from downtown Mumbai."

I requested for a change from queen to twin room and was promised a room change the following day since the hotel was fully booked on that day. However, no one reverted back regarding this and I did not chase anyone up either. The following day, due to terrible noise levels of groups gathering next to elevators and had extensive discussions right outside my room.Upon communicating these noise levels to the reception, I was yet again promised a room change. Hours later, all i can say was the were just empty claims made by the hotel staff and neither of these staff did not follow up to change the room during my extended stay at this hotel.

2534,Honest_Reviewer965,2,Felt like the Hotel is doing me a favour by letting me stay in their Hotel.,"I have stayed in the Hotel more than 30 times now, however, of late, whenever we check in or order something in room, it appears as if the hotel is doing us a favour by providing the service. Long wait for checking with an unapologetic smile is very commonplace now. I understand that it is a very sought out hotel, but I wish I could stay in another hotel next time I am in Mumbai. Really disappointed by the service."

Upon arrival they were made to wait a long time since the staff was very busy during check in around 3-3:30pm. However the staff was very helpful especially Jinali, Deepa and Shruti. Special Thanks to DEEPA for the Sugarfree cake for my parents' birthdays. Now there was a lady managing the reception staff (name unknown) who constantly allowed foreigner guests to be taken ahead of my parents, not once, not twice but more than two occasions without even slightly acknowledging them.

2538,adygoel123,1,Worst service at grand hyatt Mumbai,I am still staying in the hotel at room 1135 while drafting this review. I had a platinum card of their membership and a regular however the service has been deteriorating on my every visit. As on today they have stooped down to a new level of courtesy less staff particularly in the breakfast restaurant in which they have just stopped caring. In the garb of a lavish breakfast they are serving adulterated food which is very unhygienic.  One has to beware before consuming.  And where are those food inspectors of food and drug adulteration act.  Stale food in the name of cheap breakfast buffet.

The biggest challenge being, the kitchen was located at the ground level whereas the service was to take place on the 12th level.  But with all the hurdles & challenges, I sincerely appreciate & thank the Banquets team for putting up a great show.

The buffet is a proper one, both for breakfast and lunch/dinner (they serve the same buffet for both meals - so if you want something different, try one of the other restaurants).  The key thing to remember here are the funky card key locks.  Unlike virtually every other hotel on the planet, you have to push the little button on the door lock (it has a little ¬´¬†target¬†¬ª emblem)BEFORE the card key lock will function.

If you want a safe bet for Americans who want just normal food, get the pizza.  It was delicious. Rooms were nice, especially for India.  Very comfortable, having all needed amenities.  They do have electric converters for American voltage built into some outlets so converters are not needed unless you have many devices. Service was wonderful.

The staff are warm and welcoming and go out of their way to assist in anyway they can.  I had a problem with the aircon in my room and they did not stop until they had fixed the problem.  The range of restaurants and bars is great and provides for any tastes.  The rooms are very well appointed with modern amenities.  The gym is excellent.  The standard WifI is woeful however so pay the extra and upgrade to the premium offering.
2583,dohaman,5,"Fantastic ""Grand"" stay.",Absolutely a fantastic stay. It is close to the airport. Check-in was easy and smooth. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. They have a bathtub in the rooms which helps you relax after a busy day at work. A complimentary bowl of fruits was given each day which was so thoughtful. Food was good. You won't be able to access any other floor other than the one which has your room. Guess its some regulation in India!! Overall a happy experience with hardly any negatives.

The rooms are comfortable, modern and well equipped. I stayed in a 1 bedroom suite in the 'residences' section of the hotel and also in a hotel room as well. The suite was nice and secluded and hotel room was nice as well but a little more human traffic. I will definitely be staying here again, possibly every time I visit Mumbai."

Guys you will have a feel of Hongkong in some parts of the hotel. I had a stay in their Residency 1 BHK apartment, that is connected in the Hotel premise. Interiors are not so great. I would rate 5 out of 10. Food also I would say very average. They win on Hospitality & space. Yes definetly it has great options for exploring Swimming pool is huge and in a good shape. Changing room is too far from the pool and it is through the Gym. Hyatt plaza has good brands to shop. They allow local vendors to deliver in your 1BHK. The cost of food is reasonable in Lobby Lounge and China Home.   I would recommend it only for there huge space that gives you a feel of staying‚Ä¶"

However, the absolute highlight of our stay were the meals at 55 East which also serves as their coffee shop for buffet breakfasts and brunches. Both the variety and the quality of the food was top notch, Their sushi in incomparable. The team is always around to attend to every need of yours. Sudhakar especially from the F&B team was a huge help at this stay and also at a family anniversary dinner which had 14 of us at a lunch buffet. Sunday brunches also include sangrias and other cocktails. Try them for a great experience yourself"
2608,Enrique,4,"Efficient, innovative","Stayed 2 days for a  conference over the weekend. The room was topnotch as expected. This is my second time at the Grand Hyatt so again lapped up the convenience of multiple plug points and USB points. No scrambling around to charge devices in relay. Loved the touch with the LED lights under the hang rail, design meets utility, its the little things. And of course more than enough hangers. No hair-dryer was a downer.   The conference was in the Grand Ballroom. Loved that ceiling, reminded me of something out of Star Wars. Yes, mind tended to wander, it was that kind of conference. The pool is just down the hallway from there. I was given a wrist band for the locker key - cool.

If you have a corporate connection, you might get a good show here.   I didn't like the way their front office behaves as they insist on charging 100% of the money + 50% additional incidentals, even before you step in to your room ! .. (example) For a stay for 2 nights @ 7000 per night, they were charging Rs. 25000 from my card during check-in !  Rest was good !"

2611,aadroit,3,Starts to show signs of ageing,"I stayed here before some years back for a business trip and chose this hotel again for this business trip.  Although the hotel was generally comfortable, it has started to show signs of ageing.  The moment I entered into the room and wanted to iron my shirt so that I could get changed to go to the office, the power tripped when i plugged in the iron.   The lightings seemed to have become dimmer also, which made reading a little difficult.  One plus point was that it provided transport to and fro my office. However, the drivers seemed to be new on the job, and not necessarily know the way although the hotel was not too far from my office at BKC.  On checking out, the front office staff seemed unfriendly, body actions appeared rude too, with throwing of stationery and reluctantly‚Ä¶"
2612,Chris R,5,Perfect Stay in Mumbai,"Grand Hyatt Mumbai is a stylish Hotel in the Santacruz/ Kalina area of Mumbai; just 15 min. by Car from Mumbai International Airport. Interaction with the staff, sleeping comfort and meals served in the Restaurants outstanding. The Hotel has in the back a smaller Shopping Mall. The SPA offers great Treatments and I will be happy to come back."
2613,Lori B,3,Customer Service Missed the Mark,"I stayed at this hotel before and had a favorable impression.  This time, I felt like there was a systematic lack of attention to customer service.  The hotel is close to the airport which is nice.  The room was clean and comfortable.  I was awakened at 6:45 the 1st morning by voices outside my room and then at 7 am, there continued to be conversation plus clanking as something was being unloaded from a storage room.  I spoke to the front desk about it later but there was no follow up from them.  At the casual dining place, there were many workers but little attention to my meal.  No water refill. The food was good.  Again, good hotel just a little off this time."

Even after that it took 30 min to some one fix my room flush. I would not recommend if you are ready to spend so much money there are lots of other options available."
2624,StanleyRodrigues145,5,Beautiful hotel in the suburbs,"The only hotel which connects western line and the Central  line towards Kalina and likes. The hotel has a superb ambience inside the view in front from the hotel is more green as it opens toward the University  of Mumbai.  The local church  ST. Anthony  makes it more attractive  as many goam,  east Indian and manglorean people  have cultural activities  .some years before I had attended the VIENNESE  WALTZ conducted at the hotel.  There is a famous bakery around it of Mumbai called Vienna bakery. So couples should take an opportunity  to be at this place as this hotel is the pride of SANTACRUZ  East."

2627,Peter D,4,Wonderful Staff,"So we have just finished a 4 month stay in the residences portion of the hotel.  It has been interesting and at times challenging.  The great thing about this hotel is the staff, from Ramesh our room cleaner, to Vishal and the staff in Celini.  The aprtments themselves are spacious although a little dated.  My main criticism would be noise, there has been times when we have had to call security to speak to occupants of the rooms above.  The hotel has appeared to rent out the residences rooms to guests who feel it is acceptable to jump around, shout, sing and generally be inconsiderate until the early hours of the morning, we are talking 3am!   Location is handy for the airport, but as this is Mumbai, you cannot just walk around the surrounding area unless you do not mind the‚Ä¶"

Just the condition of the Hotel especially with regard to the flooring and some interiors  does not meet the requirement of a 5 star Hotel in international context. Refurbishment would be required.

As a matter of fact the Taj is outstanding.

We choose to have a club room because of the facilities that come with it. I really wish we had chosen to stay else where. Even when this was brought to the attention of the manager nothing was done. I will definitely not be staying here again and would not recommend anyone else to either. Sonia

Our stay at the Grand Hyatt was very comfortable and enjoyable with high service standards. What makes it amazing place to stay at is the hotel staff. My experience with the Grand Hyatt started on the phone with Deepika Shah, asst. Front office Manager prior to our trip to India as I was enquiring about an upgrade to a suite. Upon arrival, the front office staff including Deepika attempted to make our check in as smooth as possible.

The food at the Italian and Chinese restaurants were excellent! The Chinese restaurant called House of China was a particularly amazing experience. One complaint we did have was loud and unruly guests in the room next to us. However, when we complained to management, security got the guests to quieten down, and we were offered an extended check-out and a complimentary airport transfer. We had a flight at 5am and had already checked out the day before, but staff‚Ä¶"
2655,Rohini K,4,Service is good,"The Grand Hyatt staff is very good when it comes to service for both rooms as well corporate events. They are very courteous and provide whatever you ask for. They try to make every experience of yours as best as possible.  You are allowed to bring outside food to room. So that too is an option if you want some change in food.  Few inconveniences are - extremely long walks to room from elevators; if you keep access card in room with other roommates, you cannot go up and down the elevators and you don't find any staff around to help you on uperfloors. Even if they are there, they too cannot help you as they too donot have access to any floor.  But overall very comfortable and nice hotel for stay."

Let me start by expressing how good this hotel really is. The attention to detail shown by each and every member of staff is exemplary. The team is led by Gaurav and from the moment we checked in to the moment we left, we were pampered and looked after and felt like it was home away from home.   The hotel has the wow factor as soon as you step inside, the size of the hotel is huge with high end designer shops for some retail therapy as well as three excellent restaurants, a buffet restaurant, bar and business lounges.

Thank you Grand hyatt for the wonderful experience."

We sought refuge here after being stranded due to the Mumbai floods on the 29th of August 2017. Patrons were greeted with a hot cup of chai on entering the lobby, it certainly did not matter if you were a checked in guest or not. For letting us stay as long as we thought wise and for showing kindness at a dire time, Thank you!"
2664,dattarajs2017,3,Need renovation,The security manager was rude. he just shouted at us.  rooms need renovation and also the carpet to enter the room has to be changed. check in was good. breakfast was also not upto the mark. Grand hyatt Mumbai was not upto expectation.

Close to the international and domestic Airports, In Kalina, Santacruz. Google Navigator led me to it perfectly and there are flyovers all across from Chembur onwards, to get there. The drive from Pune to the Hyatt was delightful each time i went there. the best part of this hotel is that its so peaceful and calm despite being in such a busy city. You can hear the aircraft taking off in the airport nearby, sometimes. i could see the aircraft as they left the runway and took off for the sky. What a beautiful morning view. I loved the fruit platter they send every morning to the room and the Business facilities in the room. Free WiFi was available. THe Food was excellent.

But the sales team lacks credibility, can not be trusted or relied on (stay away of them so your stay will be very pleasant."
2682,Jake C,5,Close to Airport and Business District,"Every staff member knew my name at breakfast and concierge. They were extremely kind and helpful, organised all my transfers and dinner reservations.

Sushi available in this hotel is like no other. Simply the best. Lunch and dinner buffet are more or less the same though. Staff friendliness had improved a lot since last time I went there. Overall a great place. "
2690,kavitaRM,4,good rooms and very convenient location,The rooms are pretty good and spacious - and the bathrooms have a separate bath and shower area which is great. The rooms are well kept but the bathrooms show some age. Age old problem of not having enough plug points and the master switch only no one side of the bed and not marked. Else its an excellent property with great food options.
2691,SnadraMae,5,Great nights rest,"Stayed here for an overnight stop-over in transit on the way home from a business trip. Clean, comfortable beds, excellent pillows and great staff. The only negative here was there were no snacks or drinks available (was expecting something from the minibar at least)."
2692,Esther,4,Grand Hyatt Mumbai,The room is surprisingly spacious. The upkeeping of the room is good. It is very clean. Location is superb. Extremely near the airport and very ideal for business travelers who do not want to be caught in Mumbai traffic if one chooses to stay in the city.
2693,Yash Mehta,5,Awesome Service and food,"I had visited 55East few days back, the service and food was awesome and the way hospitality was managed by a person named Rodney Vaz was commendable..kudos to him..will visit again very soon..hope to met Rodney again :) Keep up the good work!!!"
2694,ishw2017,4,Highly Recommnded for all,"excellent stay in all ways. Its my preferred one. I do recommend to everyone.

2695,Dramit1,5,Awesome service,"I had an opportunity to stay in this hotel in my India visit in July,2017. I had pretty awesome experience with services and prompt front desk people attitude. The food was awesome with 5 restaurants and I specially loved the Rajysthani one.. Shopping section with downstairs small cafe was my favorite. The guy at the front desk who was in training was so helpful and entertaining while I was waiting for my check in and he was always ready to help me in choosing places to hang out in Mumbai and restaurants to have food with in my small visit. Loved every bit of it stating from good deal on club rooms and cleanliness and beautiful view. Thank you for such a lovely experience!  "
2696,Christopher H,5,Great Stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai,My stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai was excellent. The staff is friendly and helpful. The variety of restaurants is great. It has nice gym and swimming pool. The hotel is located close to the airport and has easy access to the highway.
2697,Holly R,5,First stay of our Indian back packing adventure!,"We decided to stay in a higher end hotel for our first stop of our back packing journey and what a great decision that was!  The rooms were spacious, clean and had all the facilities we needed.  The hotel itself had a great variety of food and drinks to choose from! The gym had all the main machines (better than some of the gyms in the uk).  Jason and nilesh in the fiftyfiveeast restaurant are a credit to the hotel! They always went out of their way to make sure we were more than satisfied! Jason kept bringing us new deserts to try which were amazing but we struggled to walk up the stairs after all of the amazing food!  Would definitely stay here again, the front of house staff were very polite, welcoming and helped up organise parts of our journey!  "

Was there with my wife n one year old. Was given a complimentary cake for the Lil fellow. The was a small problem with the tub that wouldn't drain.was immediayely moved to another room.

2701,Jeannie321,4,Will come back,My regular stay in Mumbai and will always be . But it's getting crowded with many locals unlike in the past With a good mix of diversity . Hotel car conditions seem to have downgrad e though. However still one of the better hotel in Mumbai.

Staffs are cooperative and polite. Food quality is awesome. Usually I Stay in Other 5 star due to my business visit. This time with my friend suggestions had to choose Hyatt. But the one place which I haven't felt great is the spa. Usually I prefer to go in the Place where one female operates that is Ms Mahalakshmi Pillai. But still As I was damn tired.....Visited spa and believe me had to return back without taking a therapy. In front desk your staffs said they said spa is busy and not even tried  accommodating me.... You should Approach this Lady and try to get training for all staff and should learn how to train the staffs for guest relations, How to deal with guest etc‚Ä¶"

2708,Ftenny F,5,Excellent,"My stay at the Hyatt was excellent. I got an apartment and the amenities were perfect. The staff were always ready and willing to assist but I advise that the hotel should get more staff eloquent in English language as it took several attempts before understanding your requests but once understood, be sussed it will be met and surpassed.

Housekeeping staff ensure that rooms are kept clean and tidy at all times and providing enough amenities to ensure a pleasant stay."
2711,Ashish D,4,Conference,"Was there for a two days conference. Must say the hotel is huge and the staff is very polite. The conference room was good with well organised tables and adequate space to move on The food was good, though expected it to be much better. To be frankly speaking, not of Grand Hyatt status. Hope it is good when I visit it next time. Overall a good experience."
2712,Kamshab,5,Kamshab,Visited Hyatt after quite a gap for an interactive session in Ballroom hall 1 & 2. I found the Hotel spic & span. The starters were very good and being quietly served by an efficient staff. The interactive session was very Good with all arrangements for power point presentations and mike etc. The food in the dinner was very good specially lemon chicken . Overall a really five star experience.
2713,Prashantonomics,5,Stay worth remembering,"Visited the property for a short weekend stay while attending and organising a conference. Nights here are happening and mornings calm. In the midst of busy Mumbai suburbs this place offers a different environment. We the crew to conference checked in at 12 PM with ease and checked out again with ease. The lobby is what I liked the most, the grandoure of the hall separating the entrance and lobby is just mesmerising. Food is good, with variety and freshness. In simple terms while I was busy planning the event, this place never interrupted rather helped me do my job with much much focus."
2714,Anupam B,4,Quality of restaurants and check out was very slow,The food is way overpriced especially at 360 East. Indian restaurant is not open for lunch. It took 30 minutes to check out as all their printers was not working. Room size is great although the carpets need to be replaced
2715,sumeshkhanna,5,Really grand,Near to International Airport and its ambience is the forte .The rooms are very spacious and beds comfortable. The food was average to good but the conference facilities were good . A hotel good for conventions than for family holidays.

2719,123MmJj123,4,Good experience !,The staff here takes care of and pays attention to every minute detail and you don't have to remind them a second time for anything. Awesome food at all the restaurants. The hotel provides a good luxurious stay - but the location is not too convenient - not many exciting places around the hotel.
2720,hpanchamia,1,hyatt hotels may be heading down southwards in terms of experience,was wondering if it just me or most hyatt hotels are now degrading their standards of service.  right from the time i entered the hotel everything went wrong.  -drunken neighbours creating ruckus till 4 am. hotel staff absolutely inefficient in being able to handle them. ensuring one entire night of no sleep and missing your flight the following morning.  -room service food is below sub standards. got both italian and indian food all wrong. -elevators dont work.  -entire floor stinks and yet staff is unperturbed.  -in general absolute apathy towards understanding how important a good hotel experience is.  -only saving grace is the staff at the restaurant and quality of food.   this is one month after my disastrous experience is hyatt chennai. i might be avoiding this chain for a‚Ä¶

2723,Isichak,5,Great hotel,"I've been staying in this hotel for the past 3-4 years on my business trips to India and it seems that every time the staff manages to surprise me with their warmth and hospitality.  I traveled with my son (13) who by the way fell in love with India thanks to the Grand Hyatt staff. As it was his belated birthday they surprised him with a ""surprise party"" in the conference room. It was an extremely nice and warming gesture on their part which I'm sure my son will cherish and remember for ever.  The hotel is managed with super intelligent warm professional people. That you can see immediately. Every little issue is dealt with descretly and Swiftly   As you just enter the hotel you are greeted warmly by the security and concierge.

The Chinese restaurant is great and buffet breakfast spread is probably one of the best I've ever had.  Would love  to return to this hotel in future!"
2726,Rafid,5,A great experience with clean and spacious room,"I stayed at this hotel for three nights and had a very good stay. Staff were very friendly, food is excellent and the rooms are clean spacious and comfortable. The only thing was that the air conditioning was too cold and I had to switch off. My stay was booked by a travel agent through work from expedia. I found that a colleague who booked direct with the hotel got it nearly for half the price. Therefore try to contact them direct before booking as you may get a cheaper rate."

2728,jk1012015,5,Business,Face of the hotel - Mgr. Deepika Shah. Pleasant flair of service at every step of the way under her leadership. Consistent show stopper with an uncanny ability to anticipate the needs of guests and deliver with all round outstanding performance.  She is cut above the rest and richly deserves to be recognized and promoted. She is an asset who serves the best interests of Hyatt. Mr. Elisha at the front desk was charming and displayed a leadership and caring role which was very noticeable.  I shall return.
2729,367pankajk,5,Amazing Hospitality,i enjoyed my first stay with Hyatt. in the vicinity there are so many hotels but the services rendered by Hyatt Mumbai team is exceptionally good. The quality of food and beverages is very very good. i enjoyed the food a lot.
2730,LigitM,5,Great hotel,Great clean hotel with excellent service! Lots of options for food/beverages inside hotel. Rooms are updated and clean with friendly staff. India needs more hotels with similar or better standards than this hotel.
2731,honestfeedback120,1,Pathetic service,"Never think of traveling with family to this very hotel. This hotel is completely different from Hyatt group of hotels, staff is comprehensively clueless about hospitality, hopeless room service they just forget what's your request and you need to follow up several times to get what you need. In room TV quality is also terribly annoying and frustrating(no HD channels), food taste is just ordinary and not Indian at all (even Indian dishes). This is not a value for your money place, above all your family will definitely not enjoy the stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai and the current team will make sure that your family will have very bad time for sure."
2732,Sudipto G,5,Outstanding service and hospitality,"Grand Hyatt , Mumbai offers outstanding service and hospitality. The property is very impressive and very well managed. Staff takes personal care from check in to check out. Overall very comfortable and hassle free stay."

We had arrived way ahead of the usual check in time but believe me the staff did not even for a second blink or make us feel like fly's on the counter, which is what most of the Hotels do. But like i said not this one. They just gave us the room and even asked if we wanted a late check out.  The room was good, clean, well equipped and very comfortable. Totally loved my stay and recommend the property to who ever appreciates good service."
2734,vkarora07,5,Excellent stay,I was on a business tour and I stayed for a night at grand Hyatt. The hotel is a very good property with a very helpful staff. The room was neat and clean. Bathroom was also up to the mark. Internet wifi was also very good.

The conference rooms are quite spacious and can seat almost 200 odd people, apart from the stage where the dignitaries or panelists can be seated.  I found the food served (lunch) at these events quite tasty and delicious. There were choice, but not too many, however, adequate.  I like the spaciousness of this place."

With the fact that its hardly 15 mins drive from Airport(SCZ) helped me plan my day really well. Highly recommended for Business Travellers as it reduces travel time from Airport and take adv of early BFST. Great Service and amicable staff !  Also did I mention its only 15 mins drive to Siddhi Vinayak in early hours. If you are religious and want to check this Bucket list in your busy Mumbai trip, it is very much feasible !"

2744,Sridharan M,5,Excellent!,"A fantastic property nearer to the airport in Mumbai,  The beautifully laid out landscaped gardens were a treat to the eyes.  The artwork in the hotel is priceless.  The rooms were extremely comfortable and luxurious.  Bathrooms could have been done with privacy as a default option, instead being optional.  A health faucet in the toilets would benefit people who are uncomfortable to use toilet paper. We tried Soma for dinner and the food was delicious.  The best part, however was the breakfast, for which I wouldn't mind visiting the hotel again."

2749,S B Tiwari /,4,Decent hotel,"I loved the large size room and bathroom. The WC did not have a shower which is available in almost all Asian hotels these days.The breakfast was good. I somehow feel that they should do an overhauling,if I may say so, of all the attendent staff members. I didn't find them compatible with the positioning of the hotel. I also noticed that they paid more attention to Gora Chamda walas then to others. "

They asked the guest name and we provided the details via email to which they responded. Inspite of the same, when our guest checked-in early morning at 03.30 am, he was informed that no payment was received and his international card was charged for the same. This shows that there is no coordination at all between the rooms reservations and the front desk. It is quite disappointing and we had to cut a sorry figure in front of our esteemed client.  Though they assured that they will reverse the payment of our guest but can they reverse the loss of our reputation?  Thanks, SKJ Juris Services Private Limited."

The added benefits of the room included a complimentary airport pick up as well as access to the executive lounge. The breakfast was simply amazing - huge selection, fresh and delicious. 1 issue: the hotel was hosting a private party which carried on till late in the night. It was extremely noisy and having complained multiple times, to date I have not received an adequate apology."
2770,Sandeep Shivhare,1,Do not Allow 2 Wheeler parking,Hotel does not allow 2 wheeler parking. Traffic is pain around so you cant take your bike to save time in a rush. Better you plan early and go only with your car. This is a bad experience that a such a good hotel do not have parking available for 2 wheeler.
2771,DrKrishnendu C,5,Good hotel with very helpful staffs,Located near western express highway.It takes only 10 mins from airport.Rooms are spacious with all modern facilities. Breakfast buffet is awesome and quality of food is fantastic.You can also njoy yourself in the big swimming pool.Staffs are very helpful.
2772,KKR66,5,ALL-ROUND EXCELLENCE- SERVICE BEYOND SMILES,"This is an unsolicited review. In my 25 years with multinational organisations, I have stayed in many hotels across different continents. There are good hotels, great hotels and there is the Grand Hyatt, Mumbai.  I have recently commenced staying at this property and  find myself  immensely enjoying every stay. The property is quite large with a lot of open spaces . It   provides good connectivity to the Mumbai suburbs, downtown as well railway station. The front desk is manned adequately by seasoned and service oriented gentlemen and ladies, the check in process seldom taking more than a minute or two. The rooms are elegant, with all that one would expect from the ‚ÄòHouse of Hyatt‚Äô . The housekeeping staff is quick and efficient. I gave them 25 minutes to do up  my room while I‚Ä¶"
2773,sgoorah,3,Attention to comfort and details is average.,Staff are rather cold and aloof. Instructions are not being followed because may be the staff do not understand English. The lighting inside the room is gloomy. The rooms smelt of cigarette despite being a non smoking room.
2774,siddhartha g,5,Excellent stay,I stayed here for a night. The hotel is in perfect location. Good locality. Near the airport. The staff is great. Very helpful and friendly. Very supportive and ready to help and assist you every time. I had a late checkout. It was well taken care off and no extra charge was levied.  Mr. Aman bhutani especially was of great help. The room was well lit and spacious. Food was also very delicious.

2777,Sue D,5,Great Hotel,"I traveled with my family for 2 weeks from Boston, US and I can't say enough how much we loved this hotel. The room attendants were all so friendly and helpful. The staff in fifty five east at breakfast each morning went above and beyond.  They were all so helpful, friendly and so kind, especially Praveen, Dineish,Sahel, Chandrekhar, Sachin and Shailesh were all wonderful. All the staff were great. "
2778,thilijaya,4,"Great Hotel, very pleasant stay","We enjoyed our stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai very much. Very comfortable rooms with good facilities, polite, friendly and very helpful staff.  Only issue was if you want to eat out or walk around for your shopping you have to go a bit far. "

2780,Tushar C,4,Short Break,This property is very well located in the Suburbs. We had opted for the Club & Suite Surprise package & were very happy with almost everything during our short stay. All the Staff was very courteous & were always ready to assist for all our needs.

2782,joie218,3,"Nice hotel close to office, customer service needs improvement","The hotel is old but nice and cosy, rooms are good except that the walls are very thin, it was very noisy in the night when people are talking along the corridors.  It is also very close to the office.  However the overall customer service of the staffs working in the hotel needs a lot of improvement to enhance the hotel stay experience."
2783,nyctravel101,2,Avoidable...,"Rooms are fair but service is well below par.   Location - good if you have work in BKC, but the Trident is a significant cut above... Else the Four Seasons Mumbai has no peer once service taken into account.   Service is very sloppy - check in agents indifferent and slow; guest services take time picking up, failed twice to return calls or follow up; housekeeping careless with cleaning and a similar lack of follow up.   Road facing rooms are noisy.   Breakfast spread is good, tasty and service good even though it is very busy so can be a wait at 9 or 10am as I experienced before you're seated.   Overall, avoidable and well worth trying other BKC hotels. "
2784,sivaramprasad,4,"Meticulous service, best to stay.","You just cannot complain of anything here.  Whatever you ask they are ready to provide, and see that your stay is comfortable.  The greetings when you arrive and showing to your room everything is fine.  But everything here is automated, even executives.  No personal feeling, Its better if the service offered with a better humane face.    May be too much professionalism, If it is mixed with little personalized service would make a world of difference.   Altogether a best hotel to stay with."
2785,Keira Mason,5,Excellent,"Only 15 minutes from airport, a modern hotel that feels very safe and secure. Prompt, professional staff available to tend quickly to any guest needs- (my broken pant zipper that needed replacement by a tailor etc). Excellent hotel chinese restaurant, 24 hr room service and restaurant- large, modern and clean rooms- marble bathrooms. Beautiful outdoor swimming pool and lovely spa. The guest services from reception to bell boys to restaurant wait staff.... fantastic"
2786,DV.,5,Genuine 5 stars,"Deluxe rooms with everything you require to have a comfortable stay.    The in-room office desk set-up was perfect for business travel and allowed a very comfortable environment to work in-between commitments outside of the Hotel.   The restaurants within the Hotel provide excellent food options, including Indian, Chinese, Italian and buffet.  Staff are very friendly and accessible, looking to help out in any way they can."
2787,Jay_Shi_UK,5,Amased! Most Certainly a 5 star service!,"We usually stay at the JWM on Juhu, however a family member was staying at Grand Hyatt Mumbai and convenienced us to cancel and book here, So we did.   The Grand Hyatt Mumbai is truly an amasing hotel. From entrance you fell you are in a 5 star luxury hotel.   Our initial room was very small for two adults and 2 children (4 and 1), however the staff promptly resolved this and gave a much larger better room.  Rooms are generious size and kept to a very high standard. I could not find any fault within the rooms so though to take a wonder around the hotel whilst the wife and kids have a nap.   Around the hotel there are many meeting points and rooms, obviously this is popular for businesses.   The breakfast menu if 1st class, from English breakfast to Indian breakfast and eggless‚Ä¶"

Overall a great and comfy stay."
2789,Alipia786,5,Impeccable Service,"One of the most pleasant stays I have experienced at a Grand Hyatt international location. Wonderful rooms and wonderful staff, service was amazing would love to stay here again. The area is a bit inconvenient as it is away from a lot of things but with a short rickshaw/taxi ride one can arrive at a shopping center nearby. Upon leaving the staff went out of their  way to bring gifts to our room along with a cake which made my family very happy. Also amazing food options and coffee all day long."
2790,Suryakant D,2,Grand Hyatt Residence need urgent upgrade,"We as family booked three service apartments at Grand Hyatt Residence for more than four weeks . We have been staying in this property as this was close to Hospital. Unfortunately F&B service team seems to us extremely cold and inefficient. Quality and taste of food though is good. F&B service team in my opinion needs extensive training.  We had an unfortunate accident because of low quality furniture, as leg of a chair broke leading to fall of guest seating on it. this property needs upgrade quite as is quite run down."
2791,Chander S,5,Grand Hyatt Mumbai- the choice for a business traveler,"My Japanese business associates and I enjoyed our stay at Hyatt. We visited Soma Indian restaurant twice - the food was so good! Located at Santacruz East the hotel is 30 minutes from airport and from Bandra, the elite shopping and dining location. Of course Hyatt gives you Italian and Chinese options to choose too, at very popular in house outlets. If you are in Mumbai choose to stay at grand Hyatt for business and leisure."
2792,jyothsnac2017,1,Worst customer service,Front desk people just didn't respond to any of my requests. They always say they call back and never do. Staff in the restaurant is even worse. They don't get you water or cutlery until asked for. You have to shout at the pitch of your voice to get any attention at all.
2793,tirthankarc2017,5,Great 5 Star Business Hotel near Mumbai Airport,"Good hotel to stay. It is convenient for me because my office is in Kalina, Santacruz. The hotel is almost walkable distance from my office. Apart from that while leaving the city the Domestic and International Airport is nearby that also makes reasons for me to be at this hotel. Leaving everything beside, it is really good hotel with all modern facilities and carries the right value of Hyatt."

But the room service is not good at all , I really had my difficulties bearing various short falls from the room service , I think the Managment of the hotel has to seriously look at it and correct it otherwise there will be more un happy  customers like me ...

2795,rajeshphillips,4,Good hotel for business travel,"Stayed at the hotel on business trip, It is about 10-15 mins drive from the international terminal. Checkin was smooth. The breakfast buffet was good but was busy at peak times in the morning. asked for a takeaway but it took long to get something.  Room was clean and comfortable including the bathroom. The Grand Hyatt is a good choice if you need a Mumbai airport hotel."

2797,16outandover,4,A great choice if you need a Mumbai airport hotel,"We stayed at the hotel during a long layover at Mumbai airport.  The hotel is about a 5-10 minute drive from Terminal 2, and the shuttle service worked very well.  The hotel is a newer property that caters primarily to transit and business guests.    We arrived very early in the morning.  Check-in was efficient, and at the staff's suggestion we bought an add-on package that included breakfast and access to the executive club lounge.  The breakfast buffet was appealing, with polished service and a reasonable choice of Western and Indian dishes.  Note that the breakfast area can get extremely busy during peak times, and there may be a wait to get a table.  The executive lounge was unexceptional - a relatively quiet place to read a newspaper or get a snack, but not much beyond‚Ä¶"
2798,aayushsikri,5,Breath of fresh air,A beautiful property with some fantastic rooms (both in terms of comfort and style).  Swift check in process with a very accomadating team that openly and with a smile handle all your requests and requirements.  They have a fantastic breakfast buffet spread at their restaurant 55 East. Seating arrangements are also very good and don't make u feel cramped up.  Had dinner at their Italian specialty restaurant (antipasto platter is a must try).  Other than that had a great time even though I was staying solo I not for a minute felt lonely!  Very positive vibes!

Checking at the hotel is a exercise in itself and the front desk staff have more attitude than the GM of the hotel.   I had an early checkin and with my friends and although they were given a room, my preferred room was not ready so I waited in their room. After about an hour my room was ready was given the key but here is the surprise part. The front desk Duty Manager Ms. Deepika wouldnt allow me to go to my friends room to collect my own luggage and take it to my room  I was really at a loss of words that when I had already submitted my ID and Address proof, was staying at the Hotel for 3 nights, they have charged my card for‚Ä¶"
2800,579felixm,5,A safe haven in Mumbai,I have experienced the hotel as a safe haven of hospitality in a hot and sometimes crazy city.  From the arrival to departure I felt very well cared for and safe. All the amenities one may require are there.
2801,Rajat A,3,Could have been better,"Well built property with good views. Well lit corridors and open space. It had all the infra in place to be considered as one of the most luxurious hotel. However, stay was a mediocre experience. There were delays in room service which would create frustration. Gym and pool were good but their shower facility could be better. Concierge service was pathetic with 10-15 minutes of average waiting time. There were not enough employees to cater to the guests. There were good sides to it as well. Rooms were kept clean always with proper replacements. Food was also decent"
2802,206yannickr,5,Nice place to stay,"Atmosphere is very warm and staff very friendly, food quality is good but expensive according to me. I will definitively stay in Grand Hyatt during my next business strip in Mumbai. I already recommend the Grand Hyatt to all my colleagues from India, France, UK, US and Germany."

2805,mondki,4,"Great hotel, many amenities","A good hotel, with large, clean rooms. Superb buffet style breakfast with a lot of offerings. Front desk organised a sim-card for me with ease.  Would say that it is not the greatest location if you want to be a wandering tourist, as there is not much (i.e. shops, attractions, food) in the vicinity of the hotel."
2806,176smk,3,eck in process,"air conditioning - no proper control, it was very chilled inside the room. the control was not appropriate. time consuming check in and check out process.  you have to wait in queue for check in and check out. follow up required for bell desk to get the baggage in the room."

Great selection of Western food as well as Indian and Asian. The dosas are fab! We had dinner at the Indian restaurant, which is a ""must visit"" during your stay."
2808,manish134,1,Absolutely ridiculous Veg food,"Had been to Grand Hyatt Santacruz for a lunch with wife, looking for veg food. To our surprise there was absolutely no variety for veg food. No starters other than some salad, chat items. And the biggest surprise was no dishes ready for the main course. Also actually there was no menu itself for the veg food. But the price was same as the non-veg food. I really dont understand what have they charged for. On our complaint we were given many reasons and excuses and lot of apology from many of the staff members right from the waitor to the chef and the manager. But at the end we had to leave the place with lot of dissatisfation."
2809,George A,5,George,Had a great stay  from checkin to checkout  where great .  Had a bit of bother with a taxi driver trying to over charge us . The  door staff where great sent taxi driver on his way  we paid  proper fare . We booked a suit. It was large  was refreshed. Throughout the day . If booking this hotel. It's well worth paying. Extreme for club room or suit as the lounge is. Fabulous. Good selection of food and drink and great staff when any member of staff passed you always a big smile and hello from the start to the end great hotel
2810,Ian B,3,Reliable,The Grand Hyatt is very reliable even though it's quite basic. Check in and check out are always slow even if there is no queue. Internet is getting better but still slow. World of Hyatt as a program has detiorated significantly from the old Gold Passport
2811,Maggi5,5,It's is really grand,Right from the lobby to the room to room service n house keeping everything is to the T. The rooms are spacious and comfortable .

2814,theodorema,4,Great business hotel that's close to the airport,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt during a recent business trip. The overall experience is great.   Rooms are good - spacious with all the basic amentities, great shower. The style is more of the early 2000 - light wood. Not a very modern Grand Hyatt but decent.  The gym is very good - lots of exercise machines. Breakfast at the hotel is also very solid."

2817,Ush,5,Beautiful Hotel,"The Grand hyatt is a lovely hotel in a really convenient location. The staff are all very friendly and were very helpful with any queries. The food is also nice, we ate in the lobby area and also in the Italian restaurant.  The deco of the hotel is superb, however the rooms are aging and do require some attention. The breakfast is superb and choice is amazing we did not know where to start! as i said the staff are all very attentive to your needs and give this hotel the reputation it has got. Well done."

Right from Check-in till Check-out, everything was impeccably smooth and warm. Staff was really pleasant and the indoors gave an aura of serenity.  Cheers!"
2820,C6Cyrus,4,A solid value in an upscale hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and enjoyed our time here very much.  It has the feel of a business hotel and is a little far out from many attractions.  However, the staff is exceptional, the rooms are well appointed and comfortable, and the food is excellent.  We would definitely stay her again."
2821,DevLall,2,Upselling a mediocre product,"Wanted to book a 2 room suite.  Used their app & the option given was a 2 room residence.    It is no where close to what one would expect  from a hotel suite.  It is genuinely a long term hotel apartment & therefore should not be sold as short stay options on line.  Travelling for a day or two one wants the entire bells & whistles & not sparten rooms, no amenities, & genuinely not an atmosphere one is looking for for a quick family get away which is about luxury. The pictures on the app are definitely mockups.  Dont expect turn downs, room goodies, minibar or any other such options.  Since it is a separate building from the hotel you cannot run down for anything.   The other aspects of the visit that were poor centred about housekeeping forgetting to remove the hard board from‚Ä¶"
2822,ahlad,2,Service missing,"Unlike most Hyatt in India where service is the soul of the hotel. This one was lethargic and chaotic I say so as we stayed for five days and found service slow and inconsistent. A good holiday is also about comfort while in the hotel, which we felt was not up to our minimum expectation. Recommend the spa as that was the best part of our stay. "
2823,Madhavan H,4,Experience an Art Studio!,"Literally, a Grand Hotel, in a royal sense! Location is good, being close to the airport. When I stayed this May, 2017, the theme of the decor was 'Mumbai' with some excellent art piece on Mumbai slum, Mumbai tiffin service, Mumbai film industry, Elephanta caves...! The swimming pool is good; however it becomes sunny quite early in the morning, with not much shade in the swimming pool area, leading to tanning. There are no signages for the change room and no pool assistants were there around to help. After much difficulty I could spot the change room, but it did not have shower facilities. There is lot of scope to improve the pool area. As far as the room is concerned, it is like any other five star hotel room. Personally I would have preferred the bathroom area to have been‚Ä¶"

Great location, luxury, polite and pleasant staff. Would go back again given a chance. Mumbai really is a place to explore and take in the pleasures that India has to offer. Great cuisine down at the harbor and small bars like the Olives offering home made cask ales"
2827,Rashmika J,5,Luxury accommodation with excellent service,"We stayed here for 3 nights on a room only basis so can't comment on the food. However the hotel treated us very well and looked after our needs. The concierge were particularly helpful when we wanted to book tickets for an IPL game. Location is excellent as there are great links into Mumbai City via the local train service. This can be accessed at Santa Cruz station, a short rickshaw ride away from the hotel. The outside pool area was clean and very inviting, pool was the perfect temperature. All in all, excellent value for money."
2828,Robynaga,4,Proximity to the airport,"Very proximity to the airport (15 -20 minutes drive) but may be a bit distance for tourist attraction. The room has a good size but might be a bit small bed for 2 person. It was clean but a bit dated. The service is OK, mainly for the restaurant as it take times to get your order... e.g. 15 minutes for a yoghurt and it is not even the homemade one."
2829,Patrik A,4,Convenient location - perfect if you need to stay close to the airport,"I have stayed at this hotel at several occasions the last 5 years. The hotel is clean, safe, having a high standard and being quiet. The location is convenient - no too close and not too far away from the airport. There is a fairly well-equipped gym and the food offering is more you can ask for."

I am now coming here for over 10 years and already during my last stay I noticed some slippage in attitude but put it down to a one off and did not revisited my concerns again. However, this time I have to join others who are regulars here and have noticed a negative trend. This is no longer the hotel I reviewed in 2014! It has become long in the teeth, stains on carpets, tired looking appearance etc. - maintenance, before spotless seems to have become an issue. This used to be a true 5 star experience from p/u at the airport to farewell at the airport. The p/u still works, however when you arrive at the hotel nobody is there to‚Ä¶"

Out of 3/ 6 nights, more than half of hotel was occupied with a private party wedding guest. My room 1136/1206 was vibrating with loud party music  and managed to sleep at 5'00 in the morning. Hotel said there was no alternative room for me to change because the hotel was full house. If they told me in advance, I would have chosen other hotel."
2833,Partha C,5,Excellent Business Hotel in BKC Mumbai vicinity,Excellent Business Hotel at BKC Mumbai vicinity. I liked the 2-room executive suite with a terrace attached. This gives fresh air in the morning and relaxing stay. Very good restaurant with a variety of spread. Not so crowded GYM and a good swimming pool to relax after a tiring day.
2834,Nizar84,5,Great Hotel,"It always been a great to stay in Grand Hyatt. Let it be Dubai or Mumbai. Just this time I got some issue with a non indian lady who entered the room directly when my mom was alone. She being illiterate didn't knew and thought she is from house keeping. That lady vomited in the wash basin, and also used the toilet and didnt cleared. Also everything was messy in bath tub. Atleast that lady could have cleaned it. When i entered it was full of smell and couldn't use washroom as well. Had to then check out. The morning experience wasn't good for me. If hotel staff would like to reconfirm what i told, they can check camera between 10:15am to 11:10am. Room no. 4167."

We ordered the pan seared bassa with caponata sauce and the red snapper on a tomato olive sauce. Both were super. Soft, flaky and beautifully flavoured. The spinach caneloni on the side was excellent too. Full marks to the chef. "

Last I must thank Mr.Varun Mohan that he's really a great guy that helps me with any request or need. Do not miss a visit at that hotel visiting Mumbai...
2837,Jayesh A,5,Wonderful Property,Grand Hyatt is situated close to the airport. The staff are helpful and cooperative. Food was good. The best thing I liked about this Hotel is its fitness center. The trainer in the Gym were very helpful. I stayed in the hotel for 2 days and had a good time.
2838,PhotoManAndBookLady,4,Exactly what you would expect,"Clean and comfortable, somewhat impersonal hotel, with a corporate feel. Cool decoration in common areas. Nice food, although a bit overpriced, including a wide range of good western food and a great breakfast. Conveniently located next to the airport, but the traffic to/from is pretty bad and may take a bit longer than you would expect."

I had several technical challenges for them and they came through brilliantly.Conveniently close to the airport. Great quality food, both Indian and western. Around wonderful staff. My best trip to India by far! "
2842,charlie,4,Not happy,"My company had a conference here. When colleagues arrived late evening, they were made to wait till 3 am to check in. So when I arrived I was given a serviced apartment. The apartment was extremely basic not like a regular hotel room at all which is more convenient for a business traveller. A serviced apartment may be good for long term stay or tourists. The serviced apartment which they termed as a ""suite"" did not even have a mini bar.  When I arrived late one night after partying with friends, the security did not allow my autorickshaw in because management does not allow it. The hotel was full of mosquitoes at the bar and  in public areas. Otherwise staff and food were good"
2843,Sharon Yeo,3,Disappointing,"Evaluating hyatt in all grounds, i found my stay with them over 2 days disappointing.  1. I could not even leave a review on their website which seems to be down.  2. I checked in late on the first day, paid a premium on club room king sized bed. Was told the king sized bed rooms ran out, had to settle for twin sized beds.  3. The check in process was extremely slow, took 30mins. The person didnt tell us abt the hotel wifi login and we had to figure out ourselves. There was a special way to unlock the door but we werent told either and had to go down again to clarify because we thought our card wasnt working.  4. We ate the hotel twice, the service staff werent very friendly.  5. I called to book a hotel transfer to airport only to be told no need to book, theres plenty of cars‚Ä¶"
2844,Sam K,5,Very nice stay,"I really enjoyed staying in this hotel.   Firstly, the customer service is excellent.The staff really go above and beyond. India generally has excellent service in its 5* hotels, however the Grand Hyatt staff are exceptional. I was in India for work for 1 week, and coming back to the hotel actually did feel a bit like coming home. When arriving at the hotel, the front office manager heard me on the phone dealing with an airport drama my partner was going through  - the manager actually called her contact at the airport to help sort it out. Excellent service!    The hotel has a great vibe and it is very good looking. It has a lot going on from good restaurants, bars, a nice lobby area, to an excellent gym and pool area. I was working London hours, so got to enjoy the breakfast,‚Ä¶"

The hotel front desk was very busy a few times. But they was all very helpful!!"
2848,BMahapatra,3,Well past it's prime,"I have been a regular guest at this hotel with a Platinum passport card since 2010 and have seen much better days here. I used to take examples of this hotel when I spoke of service quality. I felt more at home in this hotel but all is gone now. I stayed a couple of weeks back here and now the hotel looks old. I used to have someone wait for me at the entrance and do the checkin in the room but now have to stand in huge queues with a unfriendly person on the counter. The fruit basket is the room has disappeared and is now only available on call. No more upgrades. However the food at the Indian restaurant was great as always. That's normally happens when hotels get old, sad but true. No more a home for me. "
2849,John F,4,"Quick Service that impressed me, No bar in fridge jus two bottles of water","I had been here jus last week, inspite of informing early checkin when reservation was done we had to wait for 45 mins, Other then that rooms were fine, when we called up housekeeping for comb which was missing in bathroom toiletries in less then a minute there was a knock on the door. Another thing there was no bar in the fridge jus two water bottles well you dont expect this in 5 star. Any way Its clean and view also is fine."
2850,Sadeesh S,1,Used Pillow Covers,I have stayed at this property several times. I'm very disappointed staying here on this trip. Not too sure about the quality of the drinking water that's served. Stained floors and to top it all used pillow covers ( used by someone who wears pink lipstick and hasn't shampooed his/ her hair for a few days) . 
2851,Shrish B,5,Seamless and efficient,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai to take a break for the Christmas holidays. The rooms were well equipped and maintained well. The restaurants were splendid, we tried the buffet for two meals and they were both excellent with a wide spread of cuisines ranging from Indian, Lebanese, Chinese etc. the dessert section was also excellent. The staff at the restaurant were very friendly and paid special attention to our requests with a nice special touch that made us feel extra welcome. The exteriors are a bit run down, but i could see extensive repair going on to spruce up the exteriors.Overall great hotel to stay. I would stay again and also recommend to others."

The Italian restaurant Celini is great, I can eat the beetroot risotto all day. Both pools are nice too and the massage I had was great! In-room dining menu offers Western and Indian food. Get a room NOT facing the courtyard, those are bigger. You won't hear any noise from the street. Special thanks to Fleur for helping me with my sari and Rohan for his services at the pool."
2854,TigerKolkata,5,Seamless and efficient,"One of the busiest hotels primarily because of location has always fascinated me as to its efficiency and top end delivery.

On arrival I was guided to go up the stairs to the reception area.  The receptionist greeted me and informed me that I would be upgraded to a suite.  My suite was beautiful, spacious and just perfect for my last night in India.  I was too tired to go to dinner that night so I retired for an early night and woke early and went downstairs for breakfast to a beautiful buffet style breakfast, food was beautifully layed out and lots to choose from, service was excellent.

The breakfast is good, but does not offer many ""European"" options. Just go for the Asian ones, since they are excellent.  China House restaurant offers simply superb food. The bar does not offer a wide variety, and prices are too high. Overall, excellent business hotel."

The staff were all excellent, and attentive to your needs, especially in the restaurants. If you are interested in getting some nice pashmina, there is a shop well hidden in the small corner of the shopping arcade wing of the hotel that sells genuine pashmina at reasonable price (its in the same floor that connects to the hotel, the shop bears a metal Kashmir tourism board logo on its glass door, and it sells mostly carpets and pashmina).

2882,11River11,5,Best Peking Duck from World class Hyatt Chinese Chef,The food in the chinese restaurant under Chef Li is so good that I forget I am miles away from home. Chef Li would frequently come out of his kitchen to socialise with me and my team who were there from Singapore. His gracious hospitality is truly the defining factor that sets Grand Hyatt Mumbai a class above other hotels that has chinese restaurant hospitality.

2884,manavt2017,4,India's Best Conference Hotel,If you are thinking of a conference then this is your best bet in India.  This is coming from someone who has done over 25 major conferences in different parts of Asia.  They get the food right and deliver things as needed.  A few down sides include a slightly tired product and that they do not have modern AV equipment and you have to therefore rent everything from out sourced vendors.
2885,gopinath b,4,Well Managed Hotel!,I was at Mumbai to attend the HICSA meet at Grand Hyatt.  The situation of early check in was handled efficiently by the duty manager. The room was comfortable and the amenities were excellent. Ultimate was the personalized wine bottle from the General Manager ( refer the photos) . I felt that the Luggage rack was small in size.

2888,SSSLondon2014,4,Family stay in Mumbai,Very good hotel with great decor and ambience. Rooms are OK if a little small. Staff are excellent and well informed. The buffet restaurant 55 East is a standard hotel buffet. Cellini Italian restaurant however is excellent and worth booking. Minor downside of the hotel location is that it is more convenient for travellers and stopovers for flights rather than for exploring Mumbai as this requires c. 30 min taxi to main interest sites in older part of South Mumbai. Only hotel taxi or pooled taxi available from hotel desk not all local taxi.  Still an enjoyable stay and would strongly  recommend it.

Comparing with the other Hyatt (closer to the airport), this one lacks the promptness and professionalism of service staff. Perhaps, the scale makes the difference."
2895,NinuMumbai,5,Fantastic Business Hotel,"I stayed here in November 2016 as part of a large corporate event organized by our organization. This is really a good business hotel to stay in. Located very close to domestic and international airports, its easily approachable to all parts of city. It offers all aspects of typical Hyatt hospitality. Through and through a comfortable stay. Nice spread of buffet. Must stay hotel in Mumbai on Business. Didn't try the pool, so can't comment on that."
2896,Katrina_QueenFire,2,Not Worth The Stay,"-Food is below expectations. Buffet breakfast is almost the same every day. I suggest you go to the pastry shop in the ground floor - at least something good to munch on.   -If you arrive early (most international flights do), no free wifi in the lobby. You need to wait to be checked-in. - The extra amount for ""executive suite"" is not worth it. The club lounge closes early. Breakfast in the club lounge is also very limited.  -Lobby is not comfortable. A lot of mosquito."

Last night for dinner a very nice starter with parma ham and melon. We continued with great gnocchi and had a very nice creamy cheescake following the recommendation of the Italian chef, Alessandro. He is a very skilled Chef who gives you a family feeling and is able to provide in his dishes the classical intalian touch completed by a modern and international style.

They have a very large choice of restaurants and the business center is very professional. Good gym. The only problem is that you are quite far from south Mumbai so if you have meetings there be ready for a lot of traffic. 
2899,NileshJasani,1,Should not be a business hotel,"A litany of bad experiences starting from lack of key cards (happening repeatedly in recent trips) when asked for extra cards, loud musical celebrations permitted by the hotel in common areas like lobby or foyer that won't allow guests to sleep or have their calls/meetings, restaurants that open for lunch at 1230 or even staff that is numerous but not attentive (forgetting cutlery while serving food, not quick enough in offering luggage assistance etc).  The manager heard all my experiences but it did not appear like he was going to really act on anything or provide me with any written response over and above the offer of some free food or similar. This hotel should change its positioning if it does not want to serve the business clients the way it should. Or Grand Hyatt global‚Ä¶"

The restaurant China House has excellent chinese food."
2901,DrammenDrammen,4,Swimmingpool a disappointment,"Stayed for 5 nights, business conference with my husband. Room and everything in it is fine, the downside this year was the swimming pool area. I tried to use it once, but it is crowded with birds of different types - using it for drinking, swimming or other stuff that birds do. No staff there to try to do something with the problem either - guess thats why they have closed the poolbar/restaurant as well. This for me isn't good enough for a 5* hotel. "
2902,mstooch,5,Great Hotel with Excellent Service,We stayed in one of the apartments of the hotel on the residence side.  It was a big two bedroom apartment with a kitchen and a living room.  The staff in the hotel are lovely and very attentive.  We had a very pleasant stay.

This summer, you might see more than just Frisbees in the air, especially if you are at Celini, Grand Hyatt. You will surely be in for a surprise to see someone spinning giant pies in the air on his fingers like basketballs or perform synchronized dance with pizza dough.  Chef Pasqualino Barbasso, two times world champion Pizza acrobat, highly acclaimed for his culinary talents, would be adding a modern touch to the authentic Italian pizza,  From spinning the pizza dough on one finger and tossing it up in the air to letting it glide over his shoulders, enjoying the acrobatics while following the rhythm of the music, this‚Ä¶"

From the moment we arrived nothing was any trouble for anyone - door staff, concierge, Club Floor team were all red hot and on their toes.  The property is big but doesn't feel impersonal because everyone really cares and shows that they do.  Advice on how to get about was great - it encouraged us to use the Mumbai rail system in spite of its passenger numbers exceeding seven million a day. There was guidance on local services when we needed them and on sights and activities.

I had stayed there in the past but went back after many years. Was disappointing to say the least ). Maybe I hold the Grand Hyatt at high levels and seeing what I got in mumbai was clearly not at par.

2919,Vinay K,4,Check in,"It is a nice hotel but due to heavy rush, folks at the reception make silly mistakes. I checked in for 3 days but was checked out after two days. I pre-authozed room rent and extra only to find at the time of check out that it was not on their record."
2920,ayodeleo630,5,Very Nice Stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai,My recent stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai was very nice. The room was very comfortable and spacious compare to other hotels I have stayed. The variety of cuisines is great and caters for everyone's taste. The staff was very friendly and polite. I will definitely stay again at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai during my next visit.

2922,KeyurP,5,A very nice hotel,Its a huge property in central Bombay. Very well organized system with efficient and prompt service Nice rooms with all amenities. Food at restaurant was good. Probably best among all Hyatts I have stayed in India.  
2923,181gkp,5,Great hotel for business travelllers,"A great hotel experience and less than 30 mts from the airport. The room service was great and the buffet breakfast has enough variety to suit all tastes. I especially liked the betroot, carrot, ginger juice which I strongly recommend"
2924,Vinod R,4,Big Rooms,"It has the biggest rooms for the starting category of the hotel rooms I have ever used.They have some nice themed restaurants -Indian, Chinese, Italian. It's a business hotel and they have made it like that. There are a lot of seating places where we can sit and discuss.  I will be visiting this hotel again very soon."
2925,Pa»õa Radu,5,Very good experience.,"I stayed at Grand Hyat for 4 nights , the room was not so big but enough for one, clean and modern design with all the facilities of a 5 star hotel bathroom big and clean, room was cleaned daily. The restaurans great the traditional indian food was  amazing,  also the asian specialties.  The italian restaurant  also great the proun was delicios. The business center as per espectation verry well equipped, the only thing a one stole toilet wich is strange for a business center that can acomodate thousands. The pool and fitness center ok  the pool anly 1.5 m deep. All and all a good experience. "
2926,Y8724IOchristopherh,5,Amazing Experience at Grand Hyatt Mumbai,My stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai was enjoyable and pleasant. The choices of restaurants is just great. The staff was always available and happy to help. It is great hotel to conduct business meetings and events. I truly had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai.
2927,Harry K,5,Another great Hyatt,Hyatt does it again...  you will love it.  Either it be service or location or comfort or luxury or food you will enjoy yourself.  And of course The hospitality of India.  Do not believe me try for yourself.
2928,chantalq2017,5,excellent hotel close to the airport,"splendid architecture, wonderful bedroom, nice swimming pool staff is just perfect, so nice and helpful the tour guide was interesting, and the driver really good big breakfast  so close to the airport, 10 minutes driving  one of my favorite hotels in india"
2929,Soumi D,5,Good Stay,Very Good Stay with humble staff. Very nice stay and centrally located. The vastness of the hotel is appealing. People at the bar and front office are very courteous. Loved the entire aura of the hotel.
2930,nicolegM2113BN,5,Grand Hyatt Mumbai Wonderful Experience,My stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai was indeed wonderful. The staff was extremely friendly and nice. If you have a chance you can get a relaxing time at the pool side and spa. It was has a great variety of restaurants. I would definitely recommend to stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai. The location is also very convenient to the Express Highway and Airport.
2931,127niklasn,5,GRAND Hyatt Mumbai Great Experience,I just stayed at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai and would for sure recommend the Hotel. The staff was very friendly and the ambiance at the hotel is indeed very pleasant. The hotel location is very good and close to the airport.
2932,Jensom,3,Not worth the trouble,"We stayed here a few weeks ago and while the service, etc etc was pretty much up to standard, what we hated was that when we had friends coming over to meet us, we were told by the front desk that you couldn't have people in your room after 10pm?!!? Ridiculous! They were only allowed after we threatened to check out. Hotel management needs to be reminded that they are running a hotel and not a student hostel."
2933,chahatcj,4,Touch of excellence,"Located just 15 mins drive from the airport, grand Hyatt is centrally located in Mumbai. Rooms are quite nice ( and I think they have option of serviced apartments for long stay ). Hotel itself is quite big with a small shopping arcade below the hotel which has exclusive brands. Hotel also have a club ( China house) which is a quite a happening party place in Mumbai.  The best part ( as a foodie) I liked was the buffet at fifty five East. Good food with options of many cuisines. They have a gymnasium with modern amenities. All in all a thumbs up for grand Hyatt Mumbai. "
2934,rohana539,2,Just another number,"Poor room condition and did not feel special or that the service was personal. The night club downstairs can be heard from the 2nd floor which you pay extra for because it is a ""club room"". Had to complain 2 times before it calmed down at Midnight on a week night."
2935,Rpungaliya,5,Awesome Stay!,"I recently stayed in the Hyatt for a work trip for 8 days. It was an amazing experience. Very relaxing, the rooms were spacious, the shower was great. The staff was very accommodating and great service. I loved the breakfast at 55 east (I think). The Indian place...SOMA had the best paneer I have had. The gym was open 24 hours (rather small) but did the job. Overall would highly recommend the hotel."
2936,aliwoollacott,5,Superb stay,"About 40 of us westerners were here for the week to attend a wedding in Mumbai. We couldn't have picked a better hotel for cleanliness and professional staff. The food here was very good and good value. The drinks in the bars were very expensive.  You need a taxi(very inexpensive) to get to shopping area and other restaurants or bars. Fabulous pool area with service. Everything you needed was provided within the hotel. Spa, gym,hairdressers and a rather upmarket shopping plaza. "
2937,nicolasfM5333ZK,1,Avoid this hotel - Much better ones around,"Worth stay I ever experienced - condition of the room (window not closing properly meaning mosquitos in the room), dust everywhere, etc. Mumbai offers many other options so don't bother yourself with the Grand Hyatt. The only good part was the food,"
2938,AMANBADYAL,5,Awesome palace,Top hotel.  Great service (except a little chaotic at check in); Inidan restaurant is 5 star as is Lebanese restaurant on top floor.  Wine is super expensive.  I would return to this hotel anytime ....overall nice

2940,scribble-n-click,5,Superb club rooms and amenities ... all but the laundry,"My wife and I spent a week in a club room in early march of 2017. We loved most things about the stay though there were  one or two small negatives.  First the main positive of the club room: Free breakfast and evening happy hours at the Club Lounge lon the first floor. Breakfast had all you would expect in a 5-star buffet but lounge rather than dining room seating. Evening happy hours from 6 to 8 PM had free drinks - good brands of whiskey, rum, beer and wine and a selection of hot and cold snacks and desserts, We often did not have dinner after the happy hours. And the lounge staff: Special mention of Chrystelle, Kevin, Karan, Deepak, Vishal and Vincent, They were superb, Of non-club staff we were pampered with special attention from Sanober Merchant and Alice.  Now for the‚Ä¶"

I found all things in place in the room, there was ample supply of all things. And if anything was required it was made available by the courteous and generos staff. "
2942,billobe1,5,Excellent,"For those who have stayed at Grand Hyatts before you get all the normal high standards. Large well equipped rooms that are kept spotlessly clean. Choice of restaurants which provide a wide range of food and drink. The pool is very nice as is the spa and fitness area. Food and drink is quite expensive due to the low value of sterling and high taxes but this is not the hotel's fault!  The great thing about this hotel was the staff. We were part of a large group from UK and elsewhere attending a wedding. The staff really got involved with us and gave us great support and attention throughout our stay which lasted a week. Without exception every member of staff was helpful, friendly and courteous.   We would like to make a special mention to Grace Pavaskar and her team for going‚Ä¶"
2943,felvicentfabila,5,Nice stay,"Nice stay on Grand Hyatt hotel. I would like to stay in my future tour. The place is about 30 minutes to the shopping mall. The place is quite and away from any noice. Nice ambiance, nice room and wonderful interior. "
2944,shounakm2017,5,The Hyatt experience,It was a great experience yet again at the Hyatt. I was very happy to find that they have maintained the same standard as before. The breakfast was a great spread as was the buffet. Reasonably priced and a great stay. 
2945,Tanuj K,5,Amazing,I always love to visit the grand haytt every time. The place is just comfortable for meetings and staying too. The service is outstanding. Place is always neat and clean. the interior is great and i love going in hyatts!
2946,vinayg175,3,Not a good experience,"Room service was too poor. We need to wait almost 30 min for every order placed with room service. I don't understand which hotel takes 30 min to deliver band aid. Morning Buffet was same as always, they didn't changed the menu in 3 days. This was strange, i have never such repeated menu in any hotel I stayed. Lounge access was only the good thing about the hotel but in lounge as well you can't order cocktail of your choice."

2948,Sonia F,4,Good location,I would stay here again only for business not holiday as it's too secluded. Restaurants are amazing and buffet bf is good I got a late checkout on request. Staff is good. Entrance security dog looked sad though ...... He needs to play !!!!!
2949,torqy,3,Over rated Hotel.,The hotel is rated as five star but can only measure up to four star standards. Expensive for the standard. Location also is not that great. There are stains on the carpet. The Sanitary works are a bit untidy for a five star. For Business purpose the hotel is good but not for a family holiday. Staff is courteous and is ready to go an extra mile to solve your problems. I had a stomach upset after the first meal in the hotel and so did a couple of my colleagues.
2950,Snehal Lunia,5,Stay,"We were here from our long flight from dubai we didn't pre booked but as i have stayed herein past and want to show my wife how awesome the property was we stayed in hotel for 2 days for rest had relaxing steam bath, food is on ok side as we love mor spicy and street foods we didn't tried restaurant but rooms were as expected good and clean !! "
2951,LuluLemon,4,Good business hotel,"We stayed there for 5 nights for business trip. Basically the location is located near the airport so don't expect to see any nice view ofMumbai except if you choose to stay near to a Taj Hotel and gates of India. You need to have transport to go other places such as restaurant, shopping place and etc. There is nothing in walking distance. There are also tuk tuk service outside the hotel if you didn't book any. All I could see is the building located near to office complex. However there is a premier shopping outlet link to the hotel and it have ATM machine there. They breakfast is good, they have choices of local tastes and international. However the room cleanliness is an issue. There are stains on carpet which the hotel should be able to solve it. Overall, the hotel is good‚Ä¶"
2952,gauravm_hk,4,"Comfy hotel, good location",It's the perfect business hotel in the otherwise chaotic city. The location is near to airport and within accessible distance to all the happening places. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. Rooms are decently good and surprisingly spacious for Mumbai. Food is an area of improvement though.

2954,Yardy133,4,Honeymoon Stay,"We stayed in this hotel as part of our honeymoon tour of India. It is located in the suburbs of Mumbai, it's ok but there are better hotels located in the Marine Parade. The Hyatt is near to the airport and in my view caters better for a business trip rather than a holiday and certainly not for honeymooners. The welcome was not the best and a little impersonal and this is added to by its sheer size. The staff are very formal rather than friendly, breakfast in the mornings is a free for all. It is modern and is self contained if this what you are looking for then ideal but if not would suggest staying elsewhere."
2955,ondnkasia,5,A beautiful oasis!,"This place is a total escape from the craziness of Mumbai, we stayed one night as a stop over and loved it all, the trump card of this hotel has to be the staff, everyone was so helpful and kind. Agnel in the restaurant was particularly helpful, 5 stars! Thank you to you all."
2956,Priya M,5,Will be back,Cannot find anything wrong with this hotel. One of the best 5 stars and great service. Such a pleasant room I got with my own garden. Love it. Will be back. Wish spa had better traditional therapists. Other than that it was awesome love it üòç magnificent structure and a stones throw away from airport
2957,kkunal,3,Large rooms and good hotel,"stayed here for the second time, reason for coming back and staying was because had an amazing experience the first time i stayed here the rooms are very spacious and well lit, bathrooms are huge and well stocked with everything one needs, good quality toiletries  the sleep quality is also good but the pillows could be a little more firm or maybe at least the guests should have an option of slight firm pillows,  when i contacted housekeeping for a firm pillow i was sent a real rock solid pillow but over all the hotel is a very good option for stay, its buffet breakfast is excellent, one thing i found lacking from my previous stay was the plates for the south Indian buffet breakfast had changed, those authentic plates gave a good feel and looked good breakfast is a must do at‚Ä¶"
2958,Jan M,5,First rate,"Stayed here for 4 nights during Feb 2017 with a group of 10 family and friends. We were visiting from Australia. The breakfast restaurant in Fifty Five East had choices wide and varied catering to all tastes. It was very well laid out. We indulged ourselves. I requested some special masala chai (the style you get on the streets) and Sachin, our waiter, actually organised the chai to be brought in from outside, the way we like it!!! - well done Sachin. Sachin also found my mobile phone which I had left at the restaurant the previous day and handed it to 'lost & found'.  One of the chefs saw me order omellete and suggested the egg bhurji. Nice recommendation.  While I was in the pool, the pool attendants left water on my lounge chair, nice touch. The free plates of fruit each day‚Ä¶"
2959,Doctor Vijay Kumar,4,Reasonably good place for stay,The hotel location is quite good especially when you are arriving by flight and your engagements are in main city area.The rooms are spacious and clean and gives a good mood and peace of mind.The buffet spread in breakfast is quite interesting for all kinds of choices.
2960,Sreejith K,3,"Was once a great Hotel, but not this time",This may be a one time fall off - but the customer service has gone down a lot compared to my previous stays. in-house dining getting wrong dishes and not communicating properly if something is not there etc. Also they even charged me for something which i did not ask for (even though I returned it) But reception guys were good enough to waive off the charges when I complained. Wasn't a good feeling this time! not the Grand Hyatt I was staying in the past!
2961,Ewa H,5,Overnight near airport,"Excellent hotel. We have been looked after very well. Complementary fruits on arrival and as much bottled water as needed including some in the bathroom. Lovely clean room with balcony, very good breakfast. Very attentive staff. Recommend  "
2962,Ambar,3,Strictly ok with bouts of good service,"The hotel is well made and has a good location. However the service is strictly ok, at best.   The noise level in the rooms is quite house and you can hear the noise from the cars on the streets. Also, the noise from the banquet halls is quite high and comes to the rooms.  The service is not great - I tried calling the laundry 2 times to no avail. Had to eventually call up housekeeping to get a response. When I gave the laundry I requested that it be sent back to my room by 6pm the next day as I had meetings. I had to send a reminder at 7pm next day to get my laundry.  I also had to call house keeping 2 times to get glasses in my room. (In 30 mins or so).  I think the ""wake up"" call machine or person was sleeping when I called to set up an alarm. No one picked up.  The breakfast‚Ä¶"
2963,Vivek,5,Excellent hotel but service has slipped slightly,"Certainly one of the best hotels in Mumbai, but service has slipped slightly in subtle ways. Example forgetting dips or ketchup with the food, no fruit in the room, food at Celini giving me a tummy upset etc. We stay there every year for NASSCOM - maybe good to come up with something new for regular visitors....a new restaurant, whatever to change it around."
2964,Ashwiniaa,4,Nice,Good place lovely stores.  Especially for shopping Indian clothes. Ma passion. Is a great store.   The restaurants are great. The 24 hour cake shop and bakery store is great.   I live shopping there. Especially Indian clothes. 
2965,astetsen,3,"Nice, modern rooms.  Inadequate mosquito control.","In terms of rooms, food, and decor, this is one of the better business hotels in Mumbai.  However, despite the staff's best efforts, they can't seem to keep mosquitoes from buzzing around the lobby, restaurants, and fitness center."
2966,errolmenon,5,Stay at the Hyatt,christelle..shaun n vincent @ breakfast very good... jyoti..Ross..gavin at the desk very amazing.. Peter the one who got ma bags to ma room was fantastic.. these guys r an asset to the hyatt mumbai property.. I wish them all the best in wateva they do 
2967,RDN,3,"Too much hype, not enough substance","Stayed for two nights for a business conference.   Room rate similar to an Oberoi or Taj, but the room quality was shoddy. The drapes were frayed, and the sound proofing was terrible so I was subjected to a band playing on their grounds until 10:30 pm.   The hostess at the restaurant for breakfast was harried and curt. Labor is not expensive - please hire a few more hosts, so that one person does not to deal with literally 100's of guests.   Same issue at check-in / check-out - only three stations and most guests are foreign nationals so process can literally take 10-15 mins per guest.   Will not stay here again. Mumbai has amazing choices for high end hotels, why settle for high priced mediocrity?"
2968,Shourjendra D,5,Awesome hotel,"I was staying in this hotel in January for an Orthopaedic Conference and was extremely pleased with  both the stay and services provided  Although at some point of time,I felt that food was bit oily and spicy,but later realized that it was due to the fact that they had served local cuisine at dinner one day and that particular food was too oily due to the way it is prepared. It was keema pau - a dish served with toasted bread and made of minced meat with local spices. The taste was great but oily it was definitely.  Rooms were well appointed and bed was extremely comfortable. The bathrooms were spacious but again I hate saying this - that why on Earth doesn't the bathrooms in some 5 star hotel have handshower beside the WC ?? Isn't this located in India ? Don't Indians stay here‚Ä¶"
2969,Mangesh J,5,Real 5 star hotel,"The hotel was booked by our company for all 150 members, the room was fantastic which I got on 6th floor. The view was really nice from window. You can enjoy bathtub, good sleep, good amenities, nice ambience, nice buffet breakfast, good service, cleanliness, wonderful room arrangement, etc. Although it seems rate is high but good facilities given compared to rate."
2970,912vineetj,4,Good experience,The overall experience is good. The staff is efficient and is keen to go out of the way to address your specific needs. There was a couple of slippages but were addressed quickly when pointed out. The staff at the restaurant (especially at breakfast) can be more pro-active to judge what customer needs. I had to look for staff to help me which should not happen.
2971,Jolanda,5,Fantastic hotel for conferences,"Great hotel near the international airport with fantastic service and friendly staff!!wise choice of excellent restaurants , nice pool and spa center as well as fitness. Despite the huge size it still feels personal !"

2973,hjagtiani,4,"""Grand"" hotel to frequent","I've been visiting this hotel for past dozen years at least once and sometimes twice a year. They do a remarkably good job of hosting a conference with 1,500+ delegates. I've enjoyed the club lounge and have been impressed with the staff who have been extremely courteous and helpful."
2974,Jainumesh,5,Good Hotel,"This hotel is near airport , anyone can reach airport easily . The rooms are big in size . Appearance of rooms and lobby is beautiful. Buffet break fast has lots of variety of food . Hotel staffs are helpful and cool. "
2975,Sunil D,4,Comfortable but service could be better,Cushy and comfy hotel with a wide range of services. Very well styled. They could stretch themselves a bit to serve clients better. We had a young child of 9 months and have seen other hotels go out of their way to ensure a comfortable stay - did not get the warm and fuzzy from service staff.
2976,ShivankKapur,5,Grand Indeed,"Great Food, Excellent staff and excellent room.  Pro Tip: Order from the all day menu when you can as the food is excellent. Do try the Lamb Burger and Milkshake.  The location is midway between the airport and Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) so very good for business travellers with meetings in BKC  This was my first stay here and must say was fairly impressed."
2977,ansharma2312,5,Amazing,This is a huge hotel and if I remember it correct it has about 540+ rooms Beautiful architecture! The staff is very polite and at the same time very friendly. It has amazing restaurants where soma was my favourite one with amazing Indian food and live tandoor as well. I had a great time at the hotel and would recommend it further
2978,SamsungExplorer22,3,Hotel with a very low customer service,"Hyatt has been a brand name for me and my team always, but same was not the case during my last stay. I was not at all happy during my 6N stay in the hotel. The reasons were various, but some of them were noisy rooms (Could hear loud noise of flights), no customer relationship feedbacks taken until I complaint during check-out. Many times you wont find essential things in your room and will need to call the customer service for providing the essentials like laundry bag and card, shoe shiners, body lotions, etc. Hotel has got some great restaurants and is recommended to use during the stay. I think that is what made it up for the other things.  All in all, you can get better hospitality in other hotels for the same rate offered here."
2979,Cristina D,5,Very good...,"It wasn t a good experience stay a week in Mumbai, but I went with my husband in a travel trip, so the best part of the week was this hotel. It was a oasis , the pool and spa were terrific and all the restaurants excelents. Very good place..."

2981,Lakshminath,3,Wedding Reception,Though aristocratic in appearance there was no organised way of presentation. It is disturbing to note inspite of large area for 2000 visitors it looked cramped to a large extent and the food quality left a tinge in the palate.
2982,Mark F,5,"Quality hotel, well situated",Stayed here for 6 nights and it was a very comfortable stay. The room was large and comfortable. Great bar and choice of restaurants too. Fantastic choice of options at breakfast. Well equipped gym and outside pool makes this a great choice for t business and leisure traveller alike.

Staff was not able to keep up with the demand. restaurant was not friendly and told that food would take 45 minutes so should go the other restaurant. but then food arrived in 15 mins."
2985,SueDen27,5,Everything one expects at a Hyatt,"We chose this hotel as it is quite close to the airport and we had an early departure. This being the case, you need to allow plenty of time when you head to and from the city as the traffic is very congested, one evening it took over an hour to return from the Gateway to India monument. Modern, large and comfortable rooms with all amenities. There's a shopping arcade as well as several good restaurants. We dined in both Soma and the Italian Cellini ..... fantastic Italian food, see separate reviews. "
2986,NikkiSoni,1,Unbelievably noisy- stay away if you want to sleep at night,Grand Hyatt Mumbai management rents out their ball room for Bollywood parties  that go on to 5 am in the morning. The noise level is deafening. I was repeatedly woken up throughout the night. This is after I was assured that I could be given a quiet room. At 4:30 am they offered to move me to another room! I should have just stayed at a different hotel. I made the mistake of staying here but I sincerely hope you don't!   I hope someone at Grand Hyatt senior management is made aware of the fact that the Mumbai hotel management is destroying their brand by earning revenue from renting out their party rooms to event managers who blast music till 5 am!  Mumbai has fabulous hotels many of which are nearby. Come to the Grand Hyatt for their great parties that last till 5 am BUT Don't‚Ä¶
2987,tikiskis,4,Convenient to airport but watch your wallet,"I booked the Grand Hyatt mainly because of its proximity to the airport during a long layover AND because the closest hotels to the airport were charging obscene rates (perhaps because it was Republic Day).  Beautiful hotel with very friendly staff. The check-in was smooth except that three of us (two adults, one child) were put into a room with one double bed. We had to request a new room which the hotel did promptly. They transported our bags around too which made the tipping thing slightly weird.  The room was clean with a large bathroom, though a funky layout. If you're into privacy, you'll need to lock down a big space. The light switches were also in weird places. It took us a while to figure out how to turn on the bathroom light.  Exploring the hotel revealed a very nice‚Ä¶"

2989,JonSellars,5,Business trip to Mumbai,Excellent hotel with great staff. Just be aware that taxes and service charges added to bills are high. Hotel has security checks both at the gate and bags are scanned before entering the hotel so you do feel safe. Being near to airport you can hear the planes but it didn't disturb my sleep.
2990,jjharv,2,Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"Although I'm a seasoned business traveler,this was my first time to Mumbai, so maybe I was just a bit shell shocked by it all.  I don't usually write bad reviews and perhaps I'm just cranky right now. However...   Just came out to sit by pool before catching flight home but have to leave due to 100s of cackling crows flying around   Gym and spa are so so  There are mosquitoes and other small bugs flying around hotel  This place is in a terrible part of town, you cannot leave hotel and just walk around   Restaurants are actually pretty good but were not always open when I wanted them to be.

2992,Milin Mehta,4,Good Place to stay,"Had been for a stay for a couple of days for two successive visits.  Location is convenient if travelling by air.  About 30 minutes from Airport towards the city.  The rooms are specious enough and well kept.  The breakfast can certainly improve,  especially Indian Breakfast.  Had a good time."

Excellent and we have enjoyed.
2995,Ashvin G,4,Super break,Leading a hectic life in mumbai needs a break to introspect on the week/ months ahead. Decided to check in and unwind. Firstly great set up and traditional Indian hospitality. The expanse of space takes you away from the humdrum of the city. This is a business and mice hotel with huge ballrooms for weddings and events but this weekend was cool. 
2996,PaulPerk02,2,Not so grand after all,"Stay here was not up to the mark to be very honest.  1. I checked in at around 12:30pm, thought I would shower freshen up and head out, so while I was showering the door bell rang and within 30seconds before I could get out of the shower and open the door the housekeeping guy entered the room, I was quiet disappointed with him because he didn't give me enough time to get out and open the door and he said that the privacy holder wasn't on the door knob and it is standard policy to open door as soon as we ring the bell, I let it slide and did not bring it to notice of the manager, but technically they are supposed to wait for at least 5 mins before opening the door.   2. The very same night, I asked for fresh bath towels and it took them about 15mins plus another call to get it to‚Ä¶"
2997,valfisher2001,5,Fantastic Hotel !!,"I would reccomend this Hotel to anyone!! We recently stayed there for three weeks and there is not one single thing I could complain about. The rooms, food and staff were 1st class. The special attention paid to visistors by the staff both inside the Hotel and the staff on the doors directing taxis and private cars were second to non. I would also like to give a special thanks to the staff in the breakfast room Aman and the team. I would certainly stay there again in the future. Thank you so very much to all invaulved!!!

2998,nkeswani,5,Home away from home...,"Grand Hyatt as we all know is known for its service and comfort. We had stayed in Grand Hyatt Mumbai for 5 nights, we were there during New Years as well. The room was huge, bed was comfortable, the breakfast was excellent... I remember enjoying all the Indian cuisines during breakfast specially the pav bhaji... the bathroom was always clean and the hot water pressure was super. We had a small misunderstanding with a waiter on the New Year's Eve dinner at the Soma restaurant but then A special mention goes to Mr Elroy Tulkar (Director of Food and Beverage) for being so helpful, he handled the whole situation so professionally and even gave us a free meal at the China House. Food at the China house was amazing, we actually dined there twice in our 5 night stay. The new year‚Ä¶"

3000,DD M,4,Cool Hotel,"I would say it is cool. Compared to other hotels of similar category, the customer intimacy will be less and you will feel less warmth. Has good facilities but I feel that it is not the value for money one can get. Location wise also I do not see it has an advantage of proximity to outside food, plazas or restaurants. Other things are just OK. It is big hotel and good for functions or events."
3001,amit2004,4,Grand but limited,"Went for a night on weekend... has a really grand entrance unlike most of the properties in india. We got upgraded to a suite, essentially due to a nuisance... this hotel seems to be quite popular for corporate events and large groups due to the sheer no of rooms they have.  We were put up in verandah suite which had its own balcony and a large French windows...with really amazing views..  Went and enjoyed the club lounge access....this does not seems to be kids friendly & comes with very limited platter unlike Marriott and ITC....  Overall well worth but then options are plenty in mumbai within similar price range."
3002,tarun2k5,4,Great location amazing rooms,We stayed for 3 nights with my business clients. Location near santacruz airport is great nd very fast one can airport nd still no noise of aircrafts. The hotel is not new but the rooms here are amazing. 
3003,Ashish C,4,Relaxing Stay in the Maximum City,"Month of September in 2016, took us to Mumbai ( erstwhile Bombay), The Financial Capital of India.    We chose this property as we had to participate in a trade exhibition, and the hotel was comparatively nearer to the venue.  We had also been wanting to stay in this property since our last visit to mumbai.  We booked through Booking.com and got a good offer. We also arranged to send our exhibition bag in advance by courior, which was received and kept in the left luggage area. Thank you.  Before I share my experience, I would like to inform the readers that it is a huge hotel with 547 Guest Rooms and  a separate section with service apartments for guests staying on long term basis .

I feel lucky to get good offers from Hyatt and enjoy the wonderful stays. Grand Hyatt hosts one of the best rooms with huge balcony. I really enjoy staying as the staff is very helpful and courteous and assist perfectly in any situation."
3005,TIZIANA M,2,Not so good,"The rooms are old and the bathrooms need a refresh. The hotel is very big and the pool is very nice. The breakfast is so and so.... I think it's too indian style and not so international like other Hyatt. It's good because you are near the international airport and the price are not so high. The staff of reception are very fast and kindly but at the principal restaurant the chef doesn't know what is a toast!!!!!!!!!!!! Please, clean the windows, clean the room, clean the carpet......"
3006,Wendy V,4,"Busy and old hotel, but still good service and loved the art pieces","The hotel is very busy when i stayed here.  Theres just so many people at lobby.  Not hotel's fault but even while my check in is bring processed, many people will just cut queue and try to get their demands done like theres no other guest bring attended to.  The hotel is old, the hall carpets are stained, didnt feel it to be a luxury hotel, like you see at hallway many housekeeping stuff, like linens at floor, etc.  And so many people at floor lobbies and hallway.    But I loved the art pieces, the room is also big, hotel cars are readily available when you need them, staff are very friendly. "

When one of the guest services executive was contacted at about 9 am on next day & was asked if there was any request in system. She said it is recorded in system and she will recheck. he never reverted . I asked house keeping for it  they didnot do anything. Some Lobby senior person visited my room but still did not provide me much required Dettol or Savlon and Band Aid .Its very sad situation and seems very weird and unusal. . Hotel and guest room condition is Good ...But it is an unsafe room.. Bath area has no mat and no handle.. If a resident has to soap his feet  it is dangerous due to unsafe bath rooms.

3009,davinapindoria,5,Great visit and great NYE,"Visited in December 2016- Honestly one of the best in mumbai.  Having had stayed in many 5 stars in Mumbai, the staff here are very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast is also AMAZING.  We also did NYE here, and was one of the best I've experienced. There was an ice made of bar and the DJ was very good. The only thing missing was the fireworks.  We also made use of the swimming pool which is very clean with a hot tub too. The poolside bar is also reasonably priced for a 5 star!  If I could give this hotel 6 stars I could, honestly thank you!"
3010,ulurusunset,3,"Pleasant stay, but...","My niece and I stayed at Grand Hyatt 2 nights during Christmas time. The hotel has an elegant ambiance. Our room had two queen size beds which were quite comfortable and the usual amenities for a 4/5* (tea and coffee making facilities, the iron & safe deposit box inside the cupboard, hair dryer, etc.). We appreciated the 2 bottles of water that were provided daily. The second evening we also enjoyed room service. The thing that bothered us really much is the disrespectfulness of some persons. There were some young Indian guests in the room opposite ours that came home late and kept on laughing and talking loud till 3 o‚Äôclock in the morning as if it were daytime. The noise woke us up in the middle of the night and we couldn‚Äôt get back to sleep. Breakfast was very good with a‚Ä¶"
3011,kaps972,4,Great place to stay,"Stayed at Grand Hyatt from 18-21 Jan for a conference. The hotel is great, good location, nice interiors, spacious rooms, cooperative staff and nice breakfast. Though there was a catch there- we were served breakfast on the ground floor where it was little cramped and the menu was not that elaborate as the one they had at the basement where it was large, good ambience, nice spread. Rest of the things were really good  Recommend it to everybody, business or leisure travellers  "
3012,Anjana A,5,Nice place,Everything was good except check in takes long time and check out. Rooms are a bit small but has everything. Nice staff. I would recommend . Business center location and service you have to pay extra unlike Hyatt in Usa.
3013,RajanJamuna,5,Nice and Comfortable,"Nice and comfortable room, friendly staff all over the hotel and multiple eating places providing sumptuous food.  Just a suggestion to the hotel: please provide health faucets in your bathroom, especially for the convenience of your Indian customers."
3014,Kim M,5,Front Office Fiasco,I was initially checked into a SMOKING ROOM without my asking for it nor did the front office ask for my preference. This created a lot of inconvenience and embarrassment. There was also a delay in the checking in process.
3015,W3994HWtoddc,5,high class hotel,"When staying in a city like Mumbai a 5 star hotel is a welcome retreat from such a bussling city. The Grand Hyatt is exceptional. Superb service and faclities and exceptional security. The Pool is amazingly laid out. Even the water brought to you as you sit down on your poolisde lounger is a wonderful touch. Room Rate was very reasonable for the quality, food however very expensive at the hotel."
3016,Hazzazza,4,Nice rooms,The Grand Hyatt in Bombay has nice and spacious rooms but it needs some renovations (the paint on the outside walls falls off). The staff is very friendly and helpful. Very good dining options are available
3017,selinap124,4,Lovely Place,"We spent a few days there over Christmas and it was a lovely experience. Well worth it. Just one tip; if you pick a smoking room the hall smells very strongly of smoke, so try and opt for a non-smoking room even if you are a smoker!"

3024,James9220,5,Excellent as expected,The rooms are spacious and comfortable. It was a relief to finally sleep on a great mattress after sleeping on so many uncomfortable mattresses. The staff are very friendly. The main issue for tourists is that it is convenient for the airport but is fairly distant from the main tourist sights. 
3025,sanjiv56,3,Great service but lacks ettiquette.,"I have stayed at the hotel many times. It used to be perfect. the execustive lounge has been my favourite. Lately the management has done away with the dress code, Its  a horrible sight to see guests walk into the executive lounge in their pyjamas and flip flops. I reckon it brings down the class by a few notches.Only hyatt in the world with that sight."
3026,ravichandar s,5,Nice experience,"Stayed here with my family for three days. We had just returned from Lonavala and my children were still talking about the resort where we stayed. After check in which was smooth and hassle free we had lunch at 55 east , the buffet restaurant. The ambience was good and the food just excellent. During our stay we dined at this place often as we just loved it. Dining experience in Soma was also worth mentioning. On new year eve we couldn't have dinners at the regular restaurants as it was overbooked by party goers. We were little upset but the lobby lounge turned the experience into a sweet memory. We enjoyed both the hotel and residence pools. Pools were well maintained and we enjoyed the residence pool the most. House keeping was spot on and house keeping personal spoke good‚Ä¶"
3027,Charlie1001,4,Good for business,"This hotel is a good choice for business, with decent rooms (although the air conditioning in my room wasn't working properly) and all the facilities that one needs in a business hotel. The location - close to the airport and many offices - is convenient and the hotel occupies a peaceful spot in what can be a very noisy city. The word ""Grand"" in the title is a bit of an exaggeration. The reality is that this is a busy, efficient business hotel with a wide range of facilities (including a functional gym, a decent pool and a range of restaurants) but if one is looking for grandeur then this wouldn't be the top choice in Mumbai."
3028,CathNic,5,Loved this hotel,"We recent visited Mumbai for our niece's wedding and had the pleasure of staying, along with our sister and her husband, at the Grand Hyatt for seven nights and loved it. It was a great retreat from the hustle and bustle of busy Mumbai. Our rooms were large and luxurious and the service was exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble for the room service staff either. At breakfast, Chandrashaker and Siddesh were very attentive and professional. The chef even printed out a recipe for omelette Indian style that I loved. On our last day, Sunday, we reserved a large table for lunch to celebrate our niece's birthday and they even organised a beautiful birthday cake.  I have to say the Sunday brunch delicious!

3029,0neRainbow,3,Non-Smoking? Hhmm..,"We had specifically booked a non-smoking room -which we did get, but little did we know that on every occasion we went to or from the lift, we would be exposed to strong smell of smoke in the corridors, as these smoking rooms were located close the lift! This was disturbing and very obvious, as also confirmed by the housekeeping staff.   On the other hand, the lobby was great and staff at check-in were most helpful otherwise. The China House food was more spicy and ""Indianised"" to local taste, rather than authentic Chinese food - still nice but not quite what we had expected."
3030,clubhead,4,Nice Hotel,Ask for a room facing the residents' swimming pool. You will hear the constant sound of car horns if you face the road. Room is sizeable and clean. Service is attentive. Hotel is a bit old though but it is well maintained. Indian restaurant serves very good India food but only opens for dinner service. Italian restaurant is nice too.

It highly satisfied my expectatives: Rooms are full-equiped, big table for working, big bed, big bathroom with all the existing toileters; indeed very confortable rooms, a lot of meeting rooms are available and a variety of restaurants are at your disposal. Besides an amazing gym is available for guests. The worst thing is the price WIFI conexion, totally overpriced."

I did not use any chargeable services and checked out next morning for onward travel. I checked when i will get my refund. Hotel staff promised me that the refund will be done on 5-7 working days.

3040,Asit P,3,HIGHLY skilled Ripoff Operation,"I write this review from Room 2917; I cannot sleep and am livid at this hotel.  In fact I just signed up with TripAdvisor SOLELY to write this review. First off, I am a very successful international businessperson based in Manhattan and who travels globally staying in 5+ star hotels in the world's top cities.   Never in my life have I encountered such a business as this.   The room is fine, for a 3-star American motel (though with no refrigerator in this hot country), however the basis of my criticism has to do with absolutely exorbitant pricing for any of the food/drink options.  Which by the way, you are stuck using due to the inability to store purchased food items or beverages + the hotel's location in the worst of the Mumbai neighborhoods.

3042,AjayKNJ,4,"Great hotel, convenient location, helpful staff, but subpar transportation services","Grand Hyatt Mumbai is an excellent hotel, but for its poor transportation services.  I stayed in a Grand Suite King room, which was simply excellent.  Check in at the club level was a breeze, staff were extremely helpful.  I dined at the club and Fifty Five East for breakfast.  The food was great.  The room service and in-room dining was nice as well.  The biggest plus point of this hotel is the excellent location and close proximity to the airports that allowed me to make a day trip to another city.  The only downside is the hotel transportation service.  Of course the car service rates are premium, which in itself is not a problem because you are paying for peace of mind in a new city.

The building is massive and feels very luxurious, although to my taste it also felt a little too big and a tad impersonal as a result: it just seems that everything is so far from your room... Rooms were exactly as you would expect at a 5* property: very large (I would say well over 30m¬≤), in great condition, with excellent beds and all creature comforts.  We thought the swimming-pool wasn't quite deep enough to our own liking (that's totally subjective) but we found it extremely clean considering the hot climate, dust and pollution that prevail in Mumbai. And we were also pleasantly surprised that it did not smell of chemicals as much as such hotel pools usually do.  One thing that we did‚Ä¶"

3047,malcolmd575,5,Wonderful experience,"The staff (Raju, Sachin, Agnel, Justin, Nilesh and many others), the food (at 55 East), the fitness areas (including the pools), created a very high-caliber overall experience. I should warn you that New Year's Eve is very noisy due to a music event."

3054,Marco K,4,"Good, very convenient  ..... but noisy",We stayed for a couple of nights at this hotel which is close to both the international and domestic airports.  The hotel is well designed and spacious and in general features a good price quality ratio - if one overlooks the close to 25 pct  taxes and other service charges that you get slammed with for everything you consume (which adds a real sting to what would otherwise be  reasonable restaurant bills)   But it is also a hotel used by people transiting in and out of India thru Mumbai. Flights come in and leave in the middle of the night. We were woken up each of our 2 nights by very load noises in the corridors - people who clearly believe that when they are awake everyone else ought to be.   So - carry your ear - plugs and all will be ok

3062,amparanjape,5,A perfect escape to relax,"Grand Hyatt Mumbai has been our perfect escape to indulge in some of the finest foods, stays, hospitality and relaxation every couple months for the last 10 years!  I started visiting this hotel in 2006.  For the next two years, I practically lived here and befriended many staff members, especially at the Grand Club.  Since 2009, we have been visiting 4-5 times a year as our perfect indulgent escape and Grand Hyatt has never failed us.  The old staff has moved on but there's no change in the level of hospitality and friendliness.  In fact, I am amazed at how much the new staff still knows me thru the comments left by the previous staff members.  It is always nice to be recognised for loyalty and it's mutual.  The various restaurants offer great food (especially like Cellini and‚Ä¶"

3066,425pieterh,4,Great Service,"My needs were mostly well taken care of, with room and food pricing providing value for money. The staff were always helpful and friendly. If you like me enjoy a little wine during a meal, watch out the prices are very high compared with hotels in other parts of the world, my only gripe."
3067,Honey C,5,Magical is the word....,"Hyatt...means life...a place full of liveliness, positivity,happiness. I went there with my friend to have a quick chit chat over coffee but we were there for 3 hours. Such a lovely please it is. I m big time foodie, so always search for good mouth watering food.  Royal is one word that passes by my mind when I think of this place. This place is so nicely done by taking care of all the small things that goes in making guests feel comfortable by the minute you step in. The decor, seating arrangements, lights, spacing of tables, the section that divides the bar counter all of this is done exceptionally well.

The service and staff at 65 East is wonderful. In short had a great time"
3070,A Tripadvisor Member,2,Not a great review,"Rooms not great, bathrooms extremely small. Will not return again. Good lobby. Good Chinese restaurant. Definitely not a room for a family holiday. Breakfast is not too great....mariott has better breakfast. "
3071,A Tripadvisor Member,4,Very Nice hotel but the location.,This is very nice hotel little expensive but again the quality. The only downside is location the view around the hotel is not best. Though its very well placed in terms of convenience. Easy access to Airport City via Western Ex Hghw but nothing to look around. Very good Breakfast expensive but worth the money. Complimentery body wash and lotions are excellent Wish i could have more (Not free)
3072,A Tripadvisor Member,3,Grand Hyatt needs a little upgrade,"The hotel has his ikon since a long time as its in the center of city.  However,  the interiors has gone 10 year old look.  The lobby should upgrade with some fresh flowers and clean lamps. The corridoor carpet it 10 years old and can discribe the age of carpet.  The light in corridoor is too bright, which hampers the look of a Star hotel. "
3073,A Tripadvisor Member,5,"""A Little Heaven in Hell""","The property is really Grand in everyway you can think of. The entrance to the Lobby, Restaurants, Banquet Halls - you name it, It's really great. The food is fantastic in variety and the chefs are very accommodating in everyway possible. All you do is describe them what you like and how. The rest is magic. The rooms are very well maintained in every detail. The staffs are always very courteous and respectful. Only draw-back in Mumbai are the roads with people, cars and filth, but once you get to a place like Grand Hyatt, you feel like you are in a different world. I recommend everybody to experience this for themselves. A little heaven in Hell for me."
3074,A Tripadvisor Member,2,"Not near airport, slum across street, bad service","This place, while flashy inside and home to an elite set of partygoers the night we stayed, just is not worth it.  Many hotels much closer to airport.  There literally is a slum across the street and the hotel air system sucks in mosquitos from it.  My first room had about 10 of the pests.  Hotel is so big service suffers.  My non-smoking room ended up a smoking room.  At first was told all rooms are ""neutral"" whatever that meant.  Demanded change (smoke plus the pests) and was strung along until got so angry was handed the keys to a nice, clean, smoke-free room.  But had to protest too much.  Stay closer to airport.  You'll be happier."

3078,sandyjb83,4,Pretty good stay,"Had a 5 night stay here. The location is fairly close to the airport though note that its closer to the domestic airport than it is to the international.  Check in was fairly quick. Hotel is clean and the location is convenient to the airport and to get into the highway quickly. There isn't much else around the hotel. Dont go about walking around outside the hotel and expect to find much.  Room itself was comfortable. Took off one stay because I was confirmed into a suite using a Diamond suite upgrade and I was booked into a regency King suite, though in reality I am not sure it even qualifies as a Junior suite. Just an extended room with some space for a couch. The room otherwise was comfortable, overlooked the inner part of the hotel. No issues with sound, plenty of plugs,‚Ä¶"

Upon check in the staff at the hotel kindly asked how my trip was and I told them of my travels.  After checking in your staff went the extra mile to make sure I was comfortable and had what I needed for the next day.    After check in Grace personally walked me down to the shops to find an extra pair of clothes for my meetings that I had scheduled for the next day.

I contacted the reception from my room and asked about the check out date and time 3 days before my check out and she gave me wrong details as 12-Dec instead of 11th. It caused me a lot of issues in terms of planning and humility at the reception as my card was locked.  2. I did not get any call on 11-Dec until 1:30 Pm IST to check or ask check out status. No one even called me on my cell to check the status and directly blocked my card. Answer of representative was my cell number was not updated in the system. It is the biggest violation of retaining customer details with regards to service.  3. I had been asked to pay for the half day unnecessary, where in the mistake was done by hotel‚Ä¶"
3082,amirr246,4,Mumbai short visit,This hotel is close to the airport. The personnel are very service minded and helpful. The breakfast buffet was on the average level but OK. The environment outside the hotel is quite noisy (at least when I was there due to some constructions work. Generally it is good value for the money.

No view but good interior with American style rooms, service apartment, gym, pool etc. Open kitchen restaurant with lavish menu and beautiful dressing."
3085,Daryl M,5,"A home away from home, albeit an expensive one","I stayed here for a total of 7 nights in Nov/Dec 2016, it's one of those hotels where the staff make you feel welcome from the get go. It's expensive but then the hotel does give you what you pay for which excellent buffet breakfasts and a range of restaurants to choose from of an evening. We were there in wedding season so the hotel was flat out all the time but this didn't see any slip in service levels.  Suggestions for improvements is the club area could probably do with a revamp and it's an interesting clash when you're going to the gym of an evening and are walking through the function space."
3086,Fernand M,5,Perfect stay in a hotel where the staff really cares for you,"Amazing stay. Great staff who do their utmost to satisfy you. Great renovated room. Great food offer with a real tasty Italian restaurant and a very good Chinese amongst others.  If you have business to do in BKC or Bandra, stay here! To me the best hotel in Mumbai with the Taj Mahal at the other end of the city. On top of it very friendly and efficient staff. Very qualified staff at the spa."

All in all it's a perfect place, yes it's more of a business place. "

And through in future, whenever, a chance to visit mumbai, once again stay in the same. The quality of the service on all parameters were found satisfactory.

Quite expensive.

I was particularly pleased again with the airport transfer service on one hand and the restaurants in the hotel on the other hand. Used the gym as well this time and can only recommend it - very well maintained and spacious so you don't have to wait on your favourite equipment being available. Will also stay here on my next trip to Mumbai."

No alerts, no mail, no messages.  Even minimum guarantees that we increased 3 days before, weren't allowed to change. They pressured us to increase it on 23rd Nov., after contract was signed 18 months back.

It has a got a very big shopping plaza.

Rooms are spacious and comfortable. The concierge is always helpful on our last trip arranging an amazing and enlightening tour of the slums which i would highly recommend as it gave a chance to see another side of mumbai. Drivers were attentive, calm and helpful as is the airport service."
3113,shakungifts,4,Big convention hotel,It's by far the biggest hotel seems in mumbai for events and conventions lots of restaurants close the the domestic and International Airports rooms have become a little old but over all a pleasent place 
3114,Lauraw03,4,Met all expectations,"This hotel is huge! The rooms are modern clean and comfortable. The staff are very helpful and breakfast is excellent. The only reason i marked this hotel down by one point is due to the night club on site, I could here the bass on both nights during my stay - I don't understand why Indian hotels have this? The airport is close to the hotel and very accessible."
3115,K4849WDshannond,5,EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS,I have NEVER in my travels across the Globe experienced such FLAWLESS Customer Service.  From the front desk staff to the breakfast staff all of my expectations were exceeded.  This hotel is ON POINT.  The room was immaculate and they anticipated my every need.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I spent a lot of time chasing up for solution or at least apology. One Mr Varun Mohan arrogantly advised me - you should check car while taking it  thoroughly - passing it on to you"
3120,lee c,1,not the best service.,"If you book a car to pick you up expect it to be late and don't bother calling the concierge as the car is always just arriving according to them. Compared to other hotels the food is expensive, however the grounds are clean and the gym is excellent."

3122,Stevenmichael H,2,Grand Hyatt Mumbai - Not so 'Grand',"Room was average with a decent bathroom. Feels like an ageing Vegas casino hotel without the casino. Outside spaces are not well kept, avoid room service as you will pay double in taxes for very average fare and do not be fooled by the Mercedes pick up from the airport. If you order a car and driver you will be given a dilapidated hack with non existent suspension on the rear end as I was and then charged earth for the privilege. Whilst most 5* hotels in Mumbai will offer you a premium car with a driver that will wait for you, the Hyatt drivers go back to the hotel before coming back to collect you. I had to wait over an hour for my driver to return, outside in a bespoke suit in 36c heat. I will not return - Avoid, there are MUCH better hotels in Mumbai for the price."
3123,Sianne D,4,Brunch with family,"We had been to celini for brunch last saturday, had a great time with family enjoying the wide range of exotic dishes. The staff was welcoming.

3125,95abhi,3,Mumbai grand Hyatt santacruz,Nice property but badly maintained. Even the club rooms are far worse than the ordinary room at say The Oberoi. Charges are double of Oberoi though! The bath with open shower area is terrible. The Chinese Restaurant is perhaps the only good aspect of this property.
3126,harishbs,3,Business like and no personal attention,Hyat is like a hotel which does you a favour by allowing you to stay there. I checked in and walked to my room alone hoping I could reach my room at 12.45am. I had the luggage sent to car by time I had breakfast but luggage reached after 15 mins. Somehow something is not clicking. Breakfast courtesy was excellent though. With ITC hospitality to compete they have to improve significantly.
3127,Saket S,4,Centre of town,"You cannot go wrong with Hyatt. So what should I write about it ? It is in the centre and hence works for all, but if planning to enjoy old Mumbai ( south) then do not stay this side. Maybe for business at andheri/ bandra Kurla best hotel in vicinity. "

The facilities are great including sauna and fitness centre and the staff who work there. Staff members are outstanding in their manner,professional courtesy and welcome. This is what service delivery should entail. Great work done by check in staff member Alexander for his warm welcome and professional courtesy and check out staff member Adip was also very professional and courteous in his approach and very helpful. The porter and baggage assistance was excellent....thanks to the courtesy and assistance of Narayan K , Umesh  and Swapnil for a job well done.. A most memorable experience.

The bar and restaurant are well maintained and I enjoyed to the fullest. Also the Grand ball rooms were excellent and echo free, so that i could attend my conference with out any disturbances. The only small problem I faced was with the reception staff who are not well aware of what is happening in the reservation section. So I faced some confusion regarding billing and payment.

3137,jk1012015,5,Business,My favorite in Mumbai and Managers like Anubhuti Singh and Deepika Shah  ensure it remains so by making the stay very comfortable. From arrival to departure our needs are well anticipated and taken care off by their team which prompts us to keep coming back on all our visits to the city. Job well done as always.
3138,Anup K,4,Stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai,Booked into the place as we had heard good reviews about fifty five east.  Stayed overnight and had an okay experience.  Have quite a few small things to fix before I can recommend to anyone else.  That said a lot of the small things do add up.
3139,ADM1955,5,Comfortable high spec hotel,"Visited Mumbai for a conference and stayed here, the conference venue. Close to international airport, although a little way out of the traditional centre of Mumbai. Taxis are cheap so this should not deter you from staying, although you should note that it's not in a residential district so no local shops / restaurants. Hotel has several very good restaurants, bar, spa gym and swimming pool, so very pleasant all round. Fantastic staff for whom nothing was too much trouble."

3142,Errol P,4,Awesome!!! Celini - Grand Hyatt - Saturday Brunch,"Thank you Wilbur Tauro and team for the lovely time we spent at the restaurant - Saturday Brunch. Neat and comfortable ambiance, polite and quick service, and melodious live band. We even met the chef. Amazing people, awesome food and a real good place to spend quality time."
3143,pramod_kurup,4,Better Stay,"Enjoyed the short stay, also recommended for long stays, excellent breakfast buffet, clean and soothing property, near to the airport, but rest all places r bit a ride far. Toilets need to be relooked, Thanks."
3144,Shawn M,5,Saturday Brunch,Thank you so much for the kind hospitality and service provide by Darrell Fernandes and a few others..  He suggested me and my friends what to try and explained  us what is too..  The ambiance and music was upto the mark.. The pasta and deserts were really..  Good Job guys!! üëçüëç
3145,shin0yb,5,Had a awesome stay and great fun with my family,"Great place to stay, its very clean, beautiful and elegant place. Staff is very friendly and understanding. Food is great too. I had a great time here with my family and my kid enjoyed a lot in the swimming pool and play area."
3146,Anil Kumar M,2,Stay at low budget hotel rather than this,Not worth the money. the property is old and services are lousy. basic necessities are not taken care of and nobody looks really serious about how you feel as guest. gave feedback even at checkout and it was like 'Ok thanks for telling us' I love Oberois for their value for money service
3147,TravellerJeffLee,5,great stay,excellent service and nice great facilities. Nice big gym too... Came to mumbai often for business trip but first time try hyatt mumbai. Did not disappoint me... Their italian restaurant serve good food too while I had it for dinner.
3148,IndiaMeenak,3,Too much brouhaha about Cellini- their Italian restaurant!,"Been there a dozen times, the food AND service fluctuate from poor to average to very good- perhaps depending on the moods of the staff there! On a good day this restaurant delights you. On a bad day, be careful for your blood pressure! Sigh."
3149,kzaya1418,4,Beautiful stay!,"excellent hotel service. We had gone to celebrate my brother's birthday...and they made it more special.... Clean and well maintained rooms, prompt room service, and good food. staff is very co-operative and eager to help you. can think of revisiting this place again."
3150,brilind,5,Visit to Daughter,"Just spent 10 wonderful days at the Hyatt visiting our daughter who lives in one of it's fantastic apartments. Beautiful hotel with all the modcons and staff to fullfill your every request. Variety of restaurants throughout the complex, shops, gym and spa's too. Two pools with towels supplied and a waitered water supply to your sunlounger. Breakfast in the Hyatt unrivalled, you name it they cook it to request. Staff throughout very courteous and nothing is too much trouble to them.  Overall a 10 star rating for this 5 star complex."
3151,Clinton F,5,Business Stay,"I love coming back to the Grand Hyatt, Mumbai because the location is perfect and the staff is absolutely amazing. This is the best choice for those visiting Mumbai and staying in the suburbs. Very clean as well."
3152,Chopdizzle,3,Surprisingly bad / business traveler,"I got off the car and came into the lobby with bags, nobody greeted me. What's more, I had to carry my bags up a flight of stairs to check in!   Check in was also pretty unfriendly, more like a US hotel than Indian hospitality  Breakfast buffet was disorganized. Was in a hurry and had to skip coffee and my dishes of choice because no server showed up/replenished  Room was small and dark    Pros: Only good things about hotel: Location (if you're a business traveler) They have a bunch of freebies in the room"
3153,RRmsrk,5,At Home Feeling,"Feeling of home created by friendly staff who remember you from past visits. Sincere to help. Great breakfast spread at E55. Club lounge is very relaxing and comfortable.  Hotel is clean, check in and out process is very quick."
3154,Jaguar_love,5,Beautiful experience,"Even before my arrival I received e-mail communications by Ms. Pavaskar that made me feel very comfortable. I traveled alone and felt very safe. The hotel staff was very helpful and enjoyed the smiles and genuine care. The food, room and general facilities were nicely decorated and very clean. Loved the art around the hotel. "
3155,Jabeen B,4,Mumbai short trip,"Overall hotel is very clean n well maintained with staffs cooperative n courteous,only the breakfast was of everage quality ,ambience and tranquility was good,I would recommend  to stay in this hotel for good value of money "
3156,meattle,5,Friendly and Helpful Team at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"I was attending a Convention at the Hotel and stayed at this property for 3 nights in October 2016. Suddenly my hearing aid battery went down and in a short time, the concierge was able to send a courier and get the right replacement! The rooms are very clean and good and spacious and the staff friendly and helpful."
3157,Eliot A,5,Hotel in Mumbai,"Stayed at this hotel as I had to attend a board meeting held there.   PRO's: clean and very effecient. The staff are very freindly and helpful. The gymn in open 24 hours a day, and is clean, spacious and  very well equipped. There are multiple resturaunts catering to any taste.  CON's: There are numerous other options including another Hyatt that are closer to the International Airport (this one is close to the local airport). The hotel is very inflexible with ""late check-outs"". The resturaunts are all fairly to very expensive. No real budget dining here. No expense was spared building this hotel, but the upkeep could be a little better (an issue in many hotels in India). Just the finer points like a clear explanation that only GOOGLE Chrome will redirect you to the hotel WIFI‚Ä¶"

3159,Trotsee,3,Review: Pros and Cons,"I often visit & set up temporary longterm shop in Mumbai and I'm responsible to find the right 4+ star hotel for an entire staff of at least 30+ to stay for longterm stay- I decided for 2 weeks to stay in 5 different hotels so I can decide which one I would commit to in the future for me and my employees- I list below pros & cons which I hope is helpful for some of you who are like me, traveling for 24 hours to reach india and hoping their stay is comfortable.   Pros: I was happy after a long flight there was staff who immediately opened my taxi door and a bellman arranging my suitcase to the room. This service in general is very nice.   The breakfast buffet is everything here and by far the best breakfast buffet out of over 10 hotel buffet restaurants in Mumbai I've eaten for 4‚Ä¶"
3160,Andrew S,5,"Conveniently Located, First Class Hotel","The Grand Hyatt Mumbai is a first-class hotel conveniently located just south of the Mumbai airport.  The hotel is in excellent condition, with comfortable rooms and many dining options.  The staff is helpful and attentive.  Internet service is good.  For dining, Celini offers excellent Italian cuisine.  China House has great Peking duck.  Soma is a first-class Indian restaurant.  And breakfast at Fifty-Five East is great.  I stay here on every visit to Mumbai, probably 18 nights a year."
3161,jlnkc,4,Great hotel that is super busy with business and other holiday makers,"The hotel is great. You can do so much without leaving the hotel and their dining options are amazing. The only thing that let's it down is the check in counters can be overcrowded, rooms could be better appointed and the room I was in seemed to be very near a club of some sort so it was very noisy at night"
3162,MichelleSCapeTownSA,5,5 Star Experience,"Grand Hyatt Mumbai is a luxury 5 star hotel located off of the Western Express Highway in Santacruz, near the airport.   Stylish and spacious rooms, superb ambience, courteous staff (especially housekeeping), amazing food (the breakfast is brilliant), awesome gym/pool/spa and good connectivity all contributed to an excellent experience.  The only issue I ever had was with some miscommunication I received from the central reservations team when I was making enquiries. When I raised the matter, it was handled and resolved promptly and very professionally.  The Long Stay Offer is excellent value for money and the experience is 5 star all the way - a big thank you to Grand Hyatt Mumbai for making my stay a memorable one.  ...and while you are there, grab an auto rickshaw to explore‚Ä¶"
3163,SandeepSheth,5,"Amazing hotel, as expected...","Had the most memorable stay here. The staff was absolutely courteous and assisted us in every way possible. The food is absolutely outstanding. Had only been to Celine, but Soma rocked too. The food there is fantastic. A must visit place."
3164,Hardeep Kaur D,5,Pleasant stay,"Grand Hyatt offers a pleasant stay for personal or business purposes - clean, modern looking, efficient and pleasant hospitality. Staff is helpful and efficient though they could experiment with widening their food options to make it interesting for a much longer stay."
3165,Roel R,4,Close to international airport,"Great hotel for business in Mumbai. Well secured from the outside world. I was there at the end of the 10 days celebration when the locals where bringing there statues with elephant heads to the river.  There was a lot of noise in the streets but that ended luckily around 23:00.  The hotel offers a great breakfast of continental, Indian, and other Asians food. A nice fresh fruit bar at breakfast and great strong coffee. For dinner there are several restaurants in the hotel and I have chosen the Indian one. The only non spicy fish dish was recommended to me. It was delicious but being European, it was almost at the limit of spices that I could handle.  Rooms are spacious with all you expect from a luxurious hotel."
3166,Hendy L,5,Great hotel in Mumbai,"Really huge hotel in nice area. Check-in is quick and front office staff is very friendly even though she was having a light flu.   Room is spacious with good amenities. WiFi is fast.  However, TV screen in my room has strange color on the picture, maybe just bad reception. I didn't bother to fix it since I'm only staying the night anyway.  Facilities like bathroom, pool, gym are all in excellent condition."
3167,Traveleasy15,4,Nice place to stay and Dine,"Good property with good ambience, and multicuisine restaurant, needless to say palatable and tasty food. Nice comfortable rooms, and good in house service. Swimming pool site is not well maintained, and needs improvement."
3168,Jack B,5,It's always hard to leave the Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"This was my fifth stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai.  Really a wonderful experience every time. The location is far enough away from the hustle and chaos that is Mumbai. The staff is simply the best .  Everyone is friendly, professional, and courteous. The food is great too.  Great morning buffet."
3169,Ankur19892,5,"The more you stay here, more the fun","I love the gym, spa and pool facility, it is really amazing. No other hotel I visited have these magnitude of design. Breakfast was a big plus. Hospitality is nice and all staff members are caring. Good place for long and short visit."
3170,KenM62,5,Break at Grand Hyatt,A great hotel. Not the best of locations but what the hotel lacks in location is made up by their wonderful staff. Staff remember you by name as returning guests. Kevin and his colleagues in Club Executive Lounge were excellent ambassadors for the hotel. Angel in Somma was very helpful and attentive. The Chef in Somma accommodated as by preparing dishes that were not on the menu. 
3171,Freq_Traveler_101,4,Big busy hotel in Mumbai,"I had two stays over the past month here. Both a bit different. As a Hyatt Diamond I've stayed at a fair number of hotels of all levels. After my first stay I was tempted to put a 3 star rating on this hotel. I checked in late, and was given a room on the club floor. No recognition of status, and no introduction of benefits, directions or questions by the front desk staff. There are a couple of types of the standard king bed rooms - one smaller, the other a larger one (which I had on my second stay) I've got to say the smaller one felt a bit cramped, functional and certainly did the job, but didnt potray the typical ""Grand"" Hyatt feel. My rates were not the cheap ones either (both in the upper 200 USDs). It was the lack of staff interaction which was a bit of a letdown really.‚Ä¶"
3172,Deven P,3,Recent Stay,"I was in Room 1210 and there were visible stains on the carpet and the toilet bowl was also stained.  The room itself had a bit of a musty smell to it. Generally the hotel room seemed a bit dated. I do love this property for its restaurants, proximity to BKC and other business places, and the two airport terminals"
3173,Kerry L,4,Good for business trip.,"Good for the business trip near airport only and nothing else.  The room was clean, excellent service, love the gym.  The hotel holds the event almost every night during my stay, and one night was too noise my roommate couldn't sleep till morning. "
3174,WindHavenResort,4,Will not know you are in Bombay,It was an unexpected stay at this hotel as I have deferred my journey from Mumbai.  I chose to stay in the hotel so that I don't have to negotiate the traffic woes of Mumbai. The room was very spacious and nicely done. Food was very good indeed. It is very close to the airport and found it was very convenient to catch your flight.  Front office staff need to be more professional as they were unable to clear the guests as quickly as possible. Overall it was a very good experience.
3175,daniella_storm,4,Great hotel and wonderful staff,"I travel a lot for work, and this hotel is excellent- the facilities, the staff, the food are all fantastic. I really want to give you five stars...And, I know I am in Asia where people like hard beds, but please, if I call and ask for a softer mattress, do more than put a thin duvet on top of my rock hard mattress... :-) "
3176,Thevarajan S,5,Good Place to Stay,"Good Ambient. Friendly & helpful staff. Good & complete facilities provided in house. Easy to negotiate with the front liners for all matters. The provide in house medical doctor for treatment and prescription. Good range of restaurants, India, Chinese, Western and multi cuisine. Good gym facility and poolside. "
3177,AshShah,2,Horrible Food And Beverage Service for Banquets,"I had visited the place for a 2 day conference on 18 and 19 Oct 2016. I must admit that the food and beverage service was horrible. First of all they have a tea / coffee service in the morning and during the tea breaks, but the staff just refuses to serve you a cappuccino even though there is the machine right behind them. On all 3 occasion's I asked for a cappuccino, I got different excuses from the same staff member like the machine is not ready / the person making the coffee is not around etc. I mean if they do not wish to serve the same why have the machine there in the first place. Secondly, during the lunch service on both days, there was a huge banging noise of the cutlery right next to the buffet area in the open. You could literally see the staff handing the empty‚Ä¶"
3178,ARUN63512,5,Great hotel,An amazing place for business and great food and nice ambience with great people not very far off from the domestic airport and business hubs like BKC. One of the best maintained properties in MUMBAI. Great staff 
3179,shonababu,5,Grand indeed,Stayed for one night for a business trip. Loved the hotel and warmth of the staff. Room was very nice and comfortable. Check in and checkout process was very quick and smooth. Buffet spread at fifty five east was sumptuous. Overall a satisfying experience.
3180,Rahul tiwari,1,Bad experience,"Staff is very poor at front office ..they had bother me again & again asking me wheather I have taken there car ..Although inform first time that I have my own car driver but still they bother ..front office is not trained properly to interact with guest .. they doesn't look like 5 star hotel staff..Neil at conceriage has bothering me again & again by calling and asking that when I will send hotel driver back. Although very bad experience to stay in Hyatt .. finally I have to inform FOM who was really good guy .. thanks to him   Regards,  Aamir khan"
3181,SamG2000,3,Gone down.....real bad,This was one of the better properties for many years. Last few years it just kept going down on all fronts. Carpets are now fading and look worn out. Mattress springs squeak so bad...can shake you up in the middle of sleep. No upgrade/ renovations  for years.Food is below average. In a conference recently the lunch was  just terrible. While the menu is from the organizers the hotel can ensure food quality.
3182,khaleelmng,5,"""One night Luxury stay""","I just stayed for a night, the hotel is truly good excellent, gorgeous lobby, fabulous art work throughout, spacious and comfortable rooms, bathroom are spacious and stain free, staff here are really very very good always received excellent service from the staff, check in and out took less then a minutes, room was ready to check in, but location is not that good, overall it‚Äôs an excellent stay in Grand Hyatt Mumbai."
3183,156chyee,4,Grand Hyatt Mumbai a good stay. Room has a pretty grand set up. I like the 4-5 bottles of complimentary water everyday.,"Grand Hyatt Mimbai room has pretty grand feel, nice set up. Comfortable and clean. I particularly like the 4-5 bottles of complimentary water, duly replenished daily.  Breakfast food selection is also very good. Service and attentiveness can be improved though."
3184,Bettina W,5,Luxury Hotel,"The Grand Hyatt is an amazing hotel!!! The rooms, restaurant, gym and spa are first class. The restaurant offers food from around the world to meet the the needs of all travelers. The gym and spa are open works 24/7. I gave myself a massage the day I arrived and it was one of the best massages of my life!  It¬¥s located very close (a couple of minutes) to the Mumbai airport and the hotel offers transportation."
3185,Vitinho F,5,An Oasis of Tranquility,"Spent a night at this hotel, on a short trip to the City. We arrived way too early to check in, as our flight reached at 4 AM. The staff were very kind enough to allocate a room to us, despite the fact that the previous night's books were not closed. We were offered a complimentary buffet breakfast, while they got our room ready. The Front office staff were superb and not at all condescending.  The rooms were fantastic and elegant. My daughter loved it, and refused to leave the room, even though we had to visit the city.  I would love to come again and stay at the hotel, if I could. It is well worth the money"
3186,vidiartist,5,Excellent place to have a quick light working lunch  business,"We visit the hotel , lobby lounge coffee shop once a fortnight , to have a light snack and tea during the lunch hour. The ambience is peaceful and have always received excellent service from the staff .  Would specially like to mention Ms.Steffi gomes  , who makes sure our order is made as per our taste and she is quick and efficient too , serving with great attitude and a pleasing smile . Hope the hotel continues with this efficient service . its always a delightful place to visit ."

3189,A_Sawhney_Hilltech,4,Grand Hyatt is good,"We stayed for 4 days at the Grand Hyatt, Mumbai. Notable point is on the third day we had to stand in line at fifty five east for our turn. The next day we pointed it out to the gentleman who came to attend on us. He introduced himself as Sudhakar Nakte, assistant manager. He was profusely sorry for something that wasn't his fault. Rather it wasn't anyone's fault. He made sure that our breakfast experience was great and personally bought tea and coffee to our table. I would call that the Grand Hyatt experience. Top notch. Rooms are quite basic and for all 4 days they placed apples. The food at the conference wasn't all that great. Staff is attentive and respectful. Service standards are commendable."
3190,Keith C,3,Great Hotel...but watch your checkout bill!,"I like this hotel and use it most times I visit Mumbai, its convenient to the airport, clean and the Indian restaurant is superb. Wifi is on off but expect that in India! The reason I downgrade to average is the check out. When you arrive you are told that your Gold Passport entitles you to 20% off food and beverage also discount off laundry and SPA. When you sign your bill and credit it to the room you are told the discount will be applied at checkout. Wrong. Its not and in my experience last week they tried to apply the discount after I challenged them but it was only for one bill. I had 4. It took a lot of demanding to see receipts calculations etc before I got what was promised. 30 minutes wasted. Oh and by the way they then informed me the 20% off beverages did not include‚Ä¶"
3191,Aaron Myall,4,Fantastic hotel with great service,"Stayed here last week on a business trip, it's a bit out of the way if you are planning on sight seeing but a beautiful hotel. The room was big and spacious, great dining in the restaurants. Very good service, it rained each day I was there but the hotels offers a free shoe shine service (probably should give a tip) which was definitely needed. It's close to airport and perfect if you have engagements in northern part of the city."
3192,Lori C,4,"Beautiful hotel, not so great location","The hotel is truly grand. Gorgeous lobby, fabulous art work throughout, spacious and comfortable rooms but far from everywhere. With traffic so unbelievable in Mumbai it took nearly two hours to get into downtown. Depending on your itinerary, you will likely love the hotel but dread the traffic."
3193,MangoRacin,4,Hyatt standard hotel,Overall the experience wasn't remarkable although staff were lovely throughout. The rooms are very nice and usual Hyatt standard.  Breakfast selection wasn't particularly high quality compared with some of the other 5 star hotels we stayed in India.  Great pool area. Chinese restaurant is excellent!
3194,nassersalamata,5,very satisfied with Grand Hayatt Service,"I am very much satisfied with quality service offered by the Grand Hayatt at Mumbai .

I always stay at Grand Hayatt when I visit Mumbai, this is best hotel in Mumbai and to location is very handy to go to Airport and to City"
3195,Carolyn N,5,"Beautifully appointed hotel, great staff and restaurants","Absolutely beautiful hotel, not as majestic as the Taj Mahal Hotel, but modern, beautifully appointed with modern Asian Art, lovely rooms and great food choices. It's only about 20 minutes from the International Airport (on a good day) and the service is incomparable. We had the opportunity to stay in a Club room, so loved the space and layout, and access to the Club Lounge with light breakfast options (the sambhar, and coconut and coriander chutneys are amazing with the dhal wadai) and light pre-dinner cocktails.   The breakfast buffet is also very good with a wide selection of options, and the Chinese restaurant is pretty authentic (though the Peking Duck wasn't available the day I went, darn it). The hotel is very accessible to Bandra and Worli, and down to the more historic‚Ä¶"
3196,adventuregirl1968,4,Very good hotel,"I stayed here for a conference that was on site. It's a very good quality hotel with suite sized rooms that are well appointed and have large windows. It is only 20mins from the international airport and an easy stay if you are attending an in house conference.   Room service was OK. Food quality was a bit patchy and most times something was forgotten. A plate, the toast etc.   Staff are very pleasant and helpful. The inhouse dining options are pretty good for India.   This hotel is not well placed for tourists - too far from the action - but excellent for business. "
3197,RalfKo,5,Perfect Stay,Perfect Hotel for a one week business trip providing excellent service and incorporating a variety of restaurants. The pool area is very inviting and ideal to spend some time at. Towels and water are provided free of charge. 
3198,Zaheesh M,3,Rooms too small for the price,The rooms are extremely small for hyatt standard. Definitely expected better rooms. After staying at hyatt hybd this is a sure let down. Please book a bigger room if ur going with family. Also ensure u take a with bf package 
3199,jatin c,1,"staff discourteous, prejudiced, rude","I am an ordinary Indian and to my misfortune (especially in this hotel ) I look like one - because that is the only reason that I can think of for the treatment meted out to me by the staff of this hotel. The ones at the reception are either not well trained or are prejudiced against non VIP Indian  guests.--They keep you in waiting, do not offer  any cooperation with your luggage and eye you with suspicion as if you are there to plant bomb in the property. I would advise any ordinary Indian travelling to Mumbai to stay away from this hotel."
3200,Chhaya73,5,Most Happening Place in Mumbai!,"The Hotel has great ambiance, awesome food, hospitable staff..its a great property to spend time over the weekends too. It is located not far from the airport and the Worli Sea Link Bridge is just around the corner that can take you for an awesome drive over the Arabian Sea!"
3201,manojprp,5,BEST HOSPITALITY IN INDIA AND BEST SERVICES .AWESOME HOTEL LIVELY,"Grand Hyatt Mumbai has always been my 1st  priority whenever i visit to Mumbai for any work.Grand Hyatt is now my second home after my current living city home.  All the Staff are very helpful and always speaks in a gentle tone. They are really helpful in every aspect.  Mrs. Deepika is the generous lady, despite being on the position of manager she is down to earth and she has always been helpful. She takes prompt decision which makes me happy and relaxed."
3202,IntrepidT766,4,Hyatt still has it,"Third stay here in recent times, switched after the Hyatt Regency slipped in its service levels. Flight was delayed, airport pick up was delayed, room was not ready which was a first....  Just when I was resigned to its being one of those days and wondering if this property were headed downhill as well, the Duty Manager Mr Rajesh redeemed the brand by quickly sorting out the issue and also upgraded me from a Club room to a jr suite.   Concierge service was competent as ever however the quality and variety of the beverages for the evening's cocktails need to be urgently upgraded to reflect the taste and preferences of the guests who have been discerning enough to stay in the club rooms and suites!"
3203,Jitender M,3,Just an average hotel,"Rooms are fine, hotel is clean and at a good location Food is average. You will get this kind of food at any five star hotel.  Service is below average. Staff foes their job but nothing like they want to please customers. For me service is what differentiates average from good and good for excellent and this was definitely not even a good one."
3204,Simon T,2,Business travel could have other choices..,The hotel is not as great as expected.  The breakfast is very crowded and food choice is limited.  The hotel is large to walk about and we try to ask for a room to stay on due to overnight flight.  The response is there are not much room available and the cost is expensive.    The cab on the front desk is always over-charge..
3205,Harish P,5,Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"Grand Hyatt Mumbai is situated close to airport and BKC. It is easy to commute from hotel to any part of Mumbai. Facilities inside hotels are excellent -- including room, breakfast (esp one must try Grand Hyatt special Pesarattu), Pool and Table Tennis area. Plenty of walking area and Gym is of course modern and well furnished. Overall I like this hotel and even membership rewards are worth mentioning. Regards"
3206,Darren V,5,Excellent Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"An exceptional hotel, room was brilliant and had good views over the central gardens. Staff were all excellent very attentive, professional and seemed genuinely helpful and interested in myself. I ate in both the Soma and China House restaurant and the food was delicious the staff gave some great recommendations and were attentive without any feeling of being crowded or rushed. I was primarily here on business but seemed quite convenient to travel around Mumbai (if that's actually possible!!!). Basically a great hotel with great facilities and probably some of the best staff I've ever encountered."
3207,Sarath S,1,Hyatt Only for the Name's sake,"I have stayed at probably 50 Hyatts around the world. And in Mumbai at least for the past 8 years.  I am regular visitor to the hotel as I visit India every 6-8 weeks. I like the Hyatts at Hyderabad, Chennai and even Bangalore (even though the building is lousy).  Mumbai Grand Hyatt is my nightmare.  It is the people that makes a difference in a hotel  This hotel has the worst front office staff in the world, specially the managers.  Other staff is generally nice. I have yet to meet with the GM even though I have been a frequent visitor to thistle for many years.  I think this hotel needs a facelift in top management.  It was not like this before.  Six weeks ago, I told the GM's assistant what I think of the hotel. Two days ago, I sent an email requesting a car pick at the‚Ä¶"
3208,flyinkiwi14,2,Why am I waiting....,"Not up to the standard of a Grand Hyatt.   Check in and check out both took over 20 mins, breakfast is always full to the point that I waited a minimum of 10 mins every morning.  On morning I skipped breakfast entirely as didn't want to stand in line up the steps into the restaurant and another morning I was asked to share a table with another guest.  Not five star. Only stay here if you enjoy standing in lines and like to pay a lot of money for hawker centre food and beverage experiences."
3209,Deepak B,4,an average 5 star hotel with the services less than 5 star,it was ok but not as expected by the name Grand Hyatt. We were expecting more. May be international brand so i miss the feeling of Hospitality with a smiling face. So many better options are available in Mumbai
3210,Rohit R,2,Extremely poor value for money,There were all kinds of sounds coming into my room.  The room is small and stinks.  The bathroom door came off the hinge.  The housekeeping service is very poor.  There is no 24 hr coffee shop.  I don't think the F&B staff really cares to make this a good experience.
3211,Svenginetteg V,5,Essence of Quality!,"The room was fantastic, as was the service. The restaurants (especially SOMA and China House) serve great food. Celini's parma ham and cheese was absolutely delicious as well. Overall, a great hotel to stay at and relax, be it business or pleasure."

3215,Yoshiki S,4,GRAND HYATT,"Great service, good room except for the broken door. The room was quite silent, so I could get to sleep very well. When I visit Mumbai next time, I must be going to stay there again. Thank you great staffs!"
3216,KelIndia,5,All can say is excellent,"I have reviewed the property before and all I can say is that they are maintaining the service, the hotel interiors and it is just a pleasure to visit .......  The only negative thing to say is the hotel is so busy that breakfast you may have to wait 10 minutes for a table ...... but that i a good sign of the occupant and the buffet.  My favourite thing i still the shower."
3217,Satish C,5,Truly Awesome Experience!!!,"Would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is looking for great hospitality, ambience, variety of food and wines. My visit was primarily for business but it would also be a wonderful experience for stay with family."
3218,GlobeRunR,4,Comfortable with Good Food Options,"While I had been to this hotel before, this is the first time I stayed there.  We were there for a conference.  The space and facilities were certainly fine for the 850 person event (could have used some chairs to eat the lunches).  There were several restaurant options that enabled us to ""eat in"" with customers for dinners.  Staff was friendly everywhere.  The art on the walls was fun and modern.  I had a good sized room, with a nice bathroom.  Best of all, the bed was incredibly comfortable!  This was important as I suffered jet lag, and was awake more than I wanted.  There was plenty of bottled water always available.  Room noise on the 6th floor was minimal (some air conditioner noise).  While I did not run outside, I did use the gym several days.  It is spacious, with nice‚Ä¶"

3220,Anuj K,4,A hotel for everyone,"The Grand Hyatt Hotel is perfect for every kind of traveler. For a foodie it has excellent restaurants & bars and the Coffee Shop has a fantastic breakfast. Those who are in to fitness have access to a well equipped gym, pool and tennis court. The rooms are spacious and have very good bathroom and a good view.  It is conveniently located 10 minutes from the Domestic Airport Terminal and 15 minutes from the International Airport Terminal."
3221,DVT26,3,Not so Hyatt,"I was there from a weekend business trip. Grand Hotel, not so grand service Average food Great breakfast Aged or sagging beds Poor wifi speeds Up keep of the rooms really bad** ** Some lights would not turn off and I had to call housekeeping twice, shout to get this problem attended.....finally electrical repairs and replacement of switch etc. dine after an hour. Some staff are good and friendly but most are bit uncourteous and at times a bit rude.  Probably will not stay there again."
3222,kpandya1409,4,Satisfying stay in Hyatt,The was very nice and comfortable. The rooms are clean and specious with nice view of court yard. Staff is very curtious and friendly. Took care of me and my family nicely including my choice of food and beverages.  
3223,Kalyani7185,5,Wow!,"It is worth the price they are charging. It is humongous. Definitely luxury. Their buffet has such huge spread. Rooms were awesome, clean and there was always someone to answer us and help us with information needed.. I know where I am staying next time I come to Mumbai."
3224,Ankit Biyani,5,Great stay near to the Airport,"We stayed for a couple of days and found the place to be value for money.  The room booked by me was spacious, modern and very clean. The bathroom was gorgeous with a shower and separate tub. The bed was very comfortable with high thread count sheets.   A 15 min drive from the Airport, the hotel is pretty near to places like Andheri, Juhu and Vile Parle. So people who have business commitments may consider this property. The Hotel also has a huge lobby where you can sit down with guests to discuss business matters.  Would stay again on my next visit. Recommend the property to fellow travelers."
3225,Royaljojny7,3,Celebrating anniversary,"What a disappointment, I thought that it would be a success to celebrate our anniversary but what a waste of Tym and money , wish had gone back to Ming Chang or Hakasan would have got fabulous service and food coz there none seem to be interested in serving us .  Walked in got seated served water given menu , and that's it . The server disappeared not be seen for the longest Tym possible so we keep waiting that someone will come and take the order for drink at least , and finally when he come and we ask if they know how to make mojiot and we get a yes so we go ahead and place the order and then again a wait of 15/20 minutes, for the order and what appears in front of us is a small glass of fresh lime soda with some flavor of some weird concentrate settled in the bottom and‚Ä¶"
3226,vmtrek_travel,4,Grandeur,"Pleasant weekend stay in the heart of Mumbai. Good decor, spacious rooms and helpful staff.   As we were allocated the top floor, we had a peaceful stay and good courtyard view.  Room booking with the call center was quick and well supported by the front office  Food was good at Fifty Five East Restaurant."
3227,jean-marc,1,unfortunate business trip,I was personally very excided to stay in this nice hotel this W-E for 5 days with my colleagues for a business trip in this area. unfortunately my trip was delayed about one day which can happen when you are travelling a lot in this part of the world. I was so surprised to receive a new booking from this hotel asking for a room charge increase about +35% because of this single day delay. you can imagine my disappointment. looks like a very warm welcome from this hotel. Never mind even if it will make my life more complicated I'm sure I will find a good alternative in Mumbai.
3228,Craig E,5,Wonderful staff,"I was taken ill when I arrived at the hotel and all of the staff went out of their way to make sure my stay was as comfortable as possible. They arranged a doctor and sent flowers to my room, which was far beyond the call of duty. Thank you!"
3229,Abhi S,5,Top Class Business Hotel in Mumbai,"All amenities of a 5-star hotel. I dont need to write more about this legenday hotel. There is a big shopping area too but I am sure Indians would find it a bit costly. The food is just perfect. Dal Makhani was mouth-watering and so were the white cheesy pasta. I've never tasted such good pastas anywhere in the world.   The best thing I like about this hotel is its staff. There will always be a hustle bustle and you will see a lot of staff members roaming around in the hotel assisting guests. And whenever you cross by someone (be it a manager or a housekeeping guy), they would very happily smile at you and that would make your day. Just love them all."
3230,7joker,5,Pleasure is mine,"It's a place where I would always say, pleasure is mine. It is one of the most unique places where every time i go there, I fall for it again. Great location, great service, great food and great ambience. "
3231,R0nPB,5,Top of the line with quality of service and hospitality,"We stayed for 3 nights on a business trip to Mumbai and considering the usual traffic in the city, we decided to stay at a hotel near the airport so it would give us an advantage of time and so we checked in at this hotel. The service was above expectation, the rooms are unconventional and modern and well cleaned. though it is far from the nearest mall (Phoenix mall) it takes about 20 to 30 minutes in traffic and 45 minutes to get to the business district. They have taxi service for drop off and pick up arrangements. Lastly, the food choices though majority are local dishes (breakfast) but that they also have other international cuisines to choose from."
3232,JohnnieHolden,5,High quality property at a very reasonable price.,"Here for 2 weeks on business, so managed to take advantage of the very reasonable 'long stay' rate, and have found the service to be very good and the facilities fine. The property could do with a bit of updating maybe but the rooms are good. The 1st floor executive lounge is good to have access to, the quality of the food and beverage is high.  As with everything in Mumbai, the traffic dictates so much, being very near to the international airport is helpful....but whether this location suits you depends on where you need to be to do your business."
3233,AmitAggrwl,4,Good rooms Good hotel Great staf,We visited in early September . The experience was ok and not so good. I will start with the bad experience we had to face. We booked 4 rooms through travel agent... 1. Although our rooms were pre-booked and even pre paid still they were not free and ready when we arrived. 2. We waited for over 2 hours in lobby to get all the rooms. A room was provided quickly though for us to keep luggage and wait but fitting 8 people and everybody's luggage in small room wasn't jusy possible for long time. 3. We request the rooms be close to each other since we are family but we took the rooms on different floors and scattered all around.  We had already waited so long didn't have the patience to wait any longer and old presents were already frustrated by now. 4. If u r a given a room of the‚Ä¶

Room service should have been better!!! Buffet breakfast and dinner was lavish!! A lot of things to improve!!!Prefer Hyatt Regency over Grand Hyatt."

3240,gbabla,3,Wasn't impressed,"Came here for business as a recommendation , one of my colleagues stays here exclusively. Location is great as its only 10min from airport. The rooms are modern style and my shower had good pressure. Service is inconsistent, the bar area was just mediocre, but the drivers are good and bellmen seemed engaged.  The food here is seriously bad. Breakfast had old chutney. I ordered a dosa and it came to me cold. The sambhar lacks any flavor and even my uttapam that was custom ordered was just plain with no taste.Much of their food is oily and the other restaurants don't have great standard of food(China house).  The gym is nice and spa is decent, I had a pretty good massage.  I just don't think this hotel is great for the price you pay. I will likely stay elsewhere next trip to‚Ä¶"

Starting from the check in process five agents standing around bumping into each others instead of helping theur customers. Called to complain about loud noises and music at 10:00 pm was told it should stopp by 10:30.  They missed the obvious point about not having the loud noises in the first place. Executive lounge server need to be hollored after to provide any kind of service. They pretend to not seeing you!  Not one of my favorite travel experience"
3242,Thisara K,4,"Excellent Hotel , but far from city centre","Visited the hotel for 3 days for a business meeting. Everything was good - excellent food. guest room is relatively small - but good for a business trip with all facilities and a good office table/chair. Large bathroom, but bidet shower not available. staff was very friendly. only negative point is it is far away from the center of the town (located in east area which is not good for restaurants , shopping, places of interest etc). But you can get a taxi near the hotel . Cost about Rs. 1,600 - 2,000 for a whole day ( 80km and 8 hours)"
3243,Maineiac24,5,Always Consistent,The Mumbai Hyatt is a superior hotel. They have everything running efficiently. The beds are comfortable. The rooms are quiet and the staff excellent. They are always willing to solve a problem or grant an unusual request.

3245,gargi2013,5,great hotel,Breakfast was super and very convenient for any work around BKC .comfortable rooms & smiling staff.-shop called THE BLUES in their shopping arcade is worth visiting for men's clothing. Italian as well as Chinese restaurants serve delicious food.
3246,Eugene D,5,Great stay in Mumbai,Third stay. Will come again. The staff at this hotel make all the difference. The hotel compensated us for some issues with transport from the airport with a late check out and access to facilities. The coctail lounge was a wonderful experience.
3247,Di Da do,5,Single for work,I stayed for 2 nights for a short business trip. I really enjoyed the spa and the Jacuzzi after my long flights from Europe. The room was also amazing with very nice view of the city. The crew of the hotel is very polite and know their job very well. The breakfast was huge! Had all the kind of things you might want to eat in the morning!  will defiantly go again!

Pick up from the airport was great, 5 minutes drive to the hotel - highly recommended if you want to avoid traffic problems. My room was spotless, modern and comfortable. Room service was amazing! Best I had in years, very tasty and professional. I would be happy to stay at this hotel on my next visit to Mumbai."
3250,LesL766,4,Extraordinary service,"One expects the best from a Grand Hyatt stay, and this one did not disappoint.  Upscale in every way, quiet well appointed rooms and seamless service.  The food is excellent in the Italian restaurant, although service is a bit uneven.  The complimentary breakfast buffet is outstanding.  As a Hyatt Diamond I booked a room on the Club floor with points, but was placed in a standard king room by mistake.  Actually, the room was so nice that I chose not to make an issue of it. When I mentioned this error later, the manager promptly and kindly credited back the points into my account.  I will definitely return and try out the Club floor next time."

3253,Gururaj Dr R,1,Grand Hyatt at Mumbai,"The check-in level of this hotel is one level above the arrival level with stairs in between and no lift service. While the rest of the stay experience was fine, upon check out, the hotel staff our roll-on suitcase down these stairs lifting the suitcase using the handles meant for rolling along a flat surface. As a result, the roll-on handles were broken - the staff did not inform us of this condition -we discovered it only at the airport when we tried to take of the luggage out of the car."

3255,Rahul T,3,Grand Hyatt Bombay - 1st impression,I loved the hotel and the room with the patio (1125) i was given.  Room comfort was great.  The toileteries fantastic. Warm n friendly staff. Food is nothing to shout about. Breakfast buffet just ok. Eggs Benedict very bad.

So I have recommend everyone to please visit hotel atleast 1 time for world class experience."
3259,VinayJha,1,Unfriendly Checkin Staff. Noisy Floor.,"Very Disappointed with the overall experience at the hotel. First on arrival, I was told my reservation was booked for some different date eventhough I had confirmation page which said I don't need to make any confirmation. Room was good but bathtub was dirty, the floor I stayed was too noisy. Its not the guest but the staff keep banging something and it was very noisy and irritating. On arrival surprise charges started poping from everywhere. First I was told to pay extra 3000 for breakfast and transportation, which was fine but at the time of checkout I was again asked to pay 2500 for drop off to airport. Its complete rip off. Paying extra is not an issue but they should be honest to guest."
3260,rahulkundan,5,Good Place to stay,We had booked almost 30 room nights in this hotel.  The hotel is good and the breakfast is brilliant. All our guests enjoyed the stay. Rooms on the 1st floor are very good with small patio outside the room.  Mr Avishek Mitra helped us throughout the stay. He was very helpful and looked after all of us as we all were checkin in and checking out at different days and time.
3261,Arun B,4,Mid Town Hotel Near New Business Centre,"Stayed for a night. Basically a good property. Architecturally, a little odd. Get down from the car and you have to climb a flight of stairs to reach the lobby. Check in and you have to walk a distance to the Elevators. Luckily, the room was not too far from the elevator. Went down for breakfast,and again you have to climb down a steep stair to reach the coffee shop. Good for folks who sit too long n meetings.  Rooms are quite good and everything works. I had stayed here maybe 7 years or so ago. But everything looks fresh and good. The shower area layout is a bit unusual and the floor is uneven leaving puddles that wont dry. So be careful you don't skid.  Buffet lunch at the coffee shop (the one where you have to walk down a flight of stairs) was full of surprisingly good‚Ä¶"
3262,Rahul Dutia,1,Visited Soma Restaurant on 25th August,We visited Soma restaurant at Grand Hyatt with family for dinner on Janmashtmi. The food is very good and delicious but sorry to say service is very bad. The person attending to us was not well trained for how to manage the table and serve food. We ordered for dessert liquor which was served in a whisky glass and when we requested to speak with the manager no one was willing to get us an audience with the manager. Finally one gentleman came forward and said he the bar tender.I asked him did he make our drink and was he a qualified bar tender he said yes to which I was shocked if was qualified he should have known liquor is not served in a whisky glass. The annoying part is the staff was not bothered to our several requests for changing the glass till we got upset with them. ‚Ä¶
3263,SurfDude68,3,A Hyatt not so Grand,"It's located strategically between the airport and BKC offices. However, it appears to be a far cry from the Hyatt I used to frequent. Service is not consistent and in some cases staff are simply disinterested to serve. During dinner, the restaurant served the incorrect order! Rooms are also beginning to look tired with not everything in the room functioning as it should. Definitely not what is expected from a 5 star hotel. "
3264,nirmal6768,5,An amazing evening.,"I was in the dressing room for a dinner and cocktails, it was an amazing evening, with the waiters servers at their best of skills, food was of different cuisine and to perfection.best time to reach is to start early to avoid traffic as it gets frustrating waiting for the traffic to clear."
3265,Richard S,5,Business Mumbai,I'm a business traveler and my time is full of meetings and rest time in my room.  Very important is the WIFI connection and how easy it is to get on.  Grand Hyatt passed on these issues.  Very fast internet and nice locations in the lobby for short meetings.  I even took a long hot bath and the tub was huge and very comfortable.  I will come back to this Hotel as the service was good but it was the way they interacted with you as they were there to be friends with you.
3266,YadavRakhee,5,Awesome hospitality,"Hat's off to the staff for an amazing customer experience. Food is good, interiors are beautiful. This place has got one of the best gyms you will come across in a 5 star hotel. Staff is very healful."
3267,MatteL2882,4,Good to Very Good Hotel,"Stayed here many times for business; not too far from the Airport and close to the new financial business area (BKC); good large gym and good selection of food.  Only gripe is that for my last trip in mid-June they credited Gold Passport points for my meal but excluded the points for the actual hotel stay (despite assurances from the Check-in counter that they had my details - and as shown on the invoice).  Alas, the Gold Passport website is also customer-unfriendly as it requires missing points requests to be submitted within 72 hours of the stay!"

For the past 4 years I'm coming to Mumbai every month for a few days for business and always staying at that hotel. First the staff are amazing,very warm and helpful with any request or need.

Get rid of them , however pleased to see that this was not the case   Enjoy .   "
3277,Akhila S,5,Family Feel from Business Hotel,"Our group was myself, my aunt, her son and my grandmother, and this hotel was described as one for business people and meetings, but the staff were so attentive and friendly that it felt like a family-friendly hotel. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast every morning and were impressed by the quality of the food at their Italian restaurant. But we were mostly impressed by how helpful and friendly all of the employees were: suggesting shopping, treating my allergy-afflicted cousin with care and patience and working to give us a Mumbai experience. We loved it all!"

Staff is the best part of the hotel. Well trained and professional.   Overall excellent place. "

Even the bathroom was quite spacious as they have incorporated the closet and dressing area into it. There is a bath tub and a shower area.  The bed was comfortable and sleep quality was quite good. We got the garden view room, which was quite relaxing, though nothing spectacular.  We had dinner and breakfast at the hotel and both meals were excellent.

But the most important is the human touch in the approach of the entire staff; be it reception person or the bell boy!!  The important thing i noticed was that there was a security guard on each floor and genuinely guarding and watching the entire floor. The property is so huge that they are arranging the tour of the entire property on request!! Worth staying!!

We splurged for the drinks and snacks package, and were not disappointed. The staff is attentive and helpful, the meals a gastronomical delight, the rooms are everything you could expect from a Hyatt and the overall experience rates as our most luxurious and comfortable stay overall.

Concierge was excellent, helped pull me out of a mess. Thanks to them.   Rooms are old now and have started showing. Even though renovation and upgradation is a big and long process, a Polish of all the woodwork and shampoo of the carpets is desperately needed.   Food, was terrible for me. Though I am basing it on one room service order, but I must say, food that sad even at regular places I would have returned, but when one pays 1500 or there abouts for a pizza, and 1300 club sandwich it feels even worse. They really need to do something."
3286,PickyglobetrotterUk,5,7th visit and still happy,"Excellent hotel, close to airport (which makes a huge difference in Mumbai...). Choose the wrong location and it can cost you hours of travelling through traffic. It's not an airport hotel though, and situated in nice grounds. Impressive hotel. Excellent staff and facilities. Will be back again soon."
3287,parvjain,1,Bad checkin experience,I just checked in to hotel and the executive  at front desk mentioned she is sending luggage at room. After waiting for sometime I called up that my baggage is not received. They said they are sending in two minutes. I again called up they said they are sending. Then I get a call that are you expecting bags in your room. We dont have bags with your name and then they searched it and sent. What a care of guest baggage. Bad experience on just start of stay.
3288,gr8AsiaTraveller,4,A good business hotel,"This is a good hotel with good service.  Nice gym, good spa and good sized rooms.  The service is dry, lacking the warmth of other Hyatt's in India.  The Indian restaurant and the breakfast buffet restaurant are great.  Fantastic location.  Good logistics for transfers from the airport"
3289,Mustafa,3,Good Service,"Great service , super smiling and cordial staff.  The pool area can be done better , Not the best I would say.  Also the breakfast area was a cramped area. Need to reduce on some tables.  No complaints about the spread üëå"
3290,ApexTravel,5,Amazing 7-star Service !!!!,Extended my stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai for a couple weeks due to their proactive and attentive personnel.  Restaurant chefs Sushant and Chandan go out of the way to customize dishes and the managers Divakar and Sudhakar always ensure top notch service.  China House chefs also provided a tour of their offerings and provide the best Duck in town. The front desk manager (Varun) went out of his way to help with detailing room types for a delightful experience. Last but not least the bellmen and security out front are always energetic and eager to help.
3291,Jeethendar M J,4,great business class hotel,"its always an amazing experience staying at grand hyatt mumbai.the best of the rooms and service is excellent.staff are courteous best and the food is excellent,The china house lounge gives you some space to unwind after a stressful day."
3292,Monika J,5,Superb service,"We stayed at this hotel during rain season and were glad to choose it. The service at the hotel and restaurant was excellent, rooms super clean and pleasant to stay. High class experience. We were also happy to have a continental food option."
3293,Ernest Takashi W,5,Excellent and Reliable Standard,Grand Hyatt is an excellent and reliable international hotel standard.  Grand Hyatt continues this in Mumbai and incorporating the traditions of India.  Close to the airport with quick access to the city.
3294,goshan,5,Wonderful place,"Stayed here for 2 separate nights on the business trip and enjoyed every minute of it. Great breakfast with tons of choices, the room was great on both occasions. We had a dinner on the last night - we went for Multi-cultural buffet, and it was a bit bland, so that's my only negative. The staff is very helpful, you can reserve a car to take you around Mumbai which we did for half a day on Sunday, and it worked out great.  Overall, it's a great choice to stay close to the airport if you have a late flight in or early flight out (for us, it was both). Definitely recommended!"
3295,Ankur19892,5,Grand living with lovely experience,"I was not sure about hotel before, but when I entered I was greeted by the hotel employees. The service was amazing and cleaning staff was very polite and they have good information. Gym was also very well equipped."
3296,Abhay01,4,Great Care!,"My wife was on a Business trip to Bombay & her last 4/5 Days there she feel quite sick.  I really appreciate the care taken by the staff till I was able to get to Bombay 3 days later ... Special Appreciation for Rushmee & Neha.  So full marks to Front Desk, House Keeping & Guest Relations!   Thanks!!"
3297,Nishan V,4,Business in Mumbai,Excellent hotel. Rooms are clean. Facilities are top notch. The gym and the pool are excellent. The variety of restaurants are good. Top notch buffet for breakfast and lunch. The Japanese food is not the best choice. Avoid that.
3298,Raphael R,5,Great Hotel,"I would highly recommend this Hotel. Great service, clean rooms and really good food. We enjoyed this place very much. If i have to go back to Mumbai, i for sure will go back to the Grand Hyatt Hotel."
3299,Wynn R,5,Another World,"This hotel had every amenity you could want inside the hotel, (sorry no golf course or polo field within the hotel grounds), Loved staying here, the different world refers to once you are outside the gate, it is full on Mumbai, not to be missed, and not for the squeemish."
3300,Yogesh L,4,True Hospitality,"Stayed here for two nights recently.  Hospitality 10/10 - very friendly staff - be it reception, restaurant or housekeeping Room review: Size: 10/10 Bathroom : 9/10 Room Cleanliness: 3/10 (Carpet was dusty in the room and I had to report that) Bed: 9/10 - comfortable You get decent sized table space for work as well  Internet speed is decent : 1.5 Mbps upload and download speed  Food: Tried First Five - good breakfast spread and buffet option.  I would say food is decided keeping in mind equal veg and non veg options. More of continental spread  Overall Hotel ambience - pleasant.  Shopping: Yes, a whole lot of shopping complex is inside hotel where you can shop in about t20+ shops there itself.  Located in business area of Bandra Kurla Complex.  Suitable for business travellers‚Ä¶"
3301,Sat N,5,Luxurious,"The hotel is a class apart, the interiors are well themed and authentic, rarely found in other 5 star premises. Hence the review.   The other facilities are as mentioned optimal. we spent time the lounge bar, a cozy place. the food was sparse but tasty."
3302,Pratyush S,5,Quite an enjoyable stay,"Well appointed rooms, and the general ambience inside the hotel is quite pleasant.  Great eating options also available at the hotel, and the proximity to the Bombay airport  as well as the Bandra area is its greatest feature."
3303,Deepak I,3,Great property but average service,The in room dining service was poor - they forgot to get my Pepsi with the Pizza. The rooms next door were very noisy and right up to 3am. Requested at 2pm tea bags to be replenished after the room was cleaned (but staff didn't replenish the tea bags during room cleaning) and didn't get them till 8pm after 3 reminders. Not the Hyatt service I am used to.
3304,Pearl F,5,Enjoyable stay,"We visited the place shortly after our wedding for a few days of rest. The room was lovely, with nice bamboo stools outside the glass sliding doors that gave us entry to the cool and serene garden area. The food was great and hotel staff courteous. The spa was amazing. They have a lovely stone wall with water running down, which looks gorgeous at night with the lights on. The multiple restaurants at the venue with the varying cuisines makes for some great food choices. There are Indian, Chinese, Italian cuisine hotels and a breakfast bar as well.  The only downside for me was the area surrounding the hotel (outside the compound), which is the local Mumbai area with dirt on the roads."
3305,dorotheew470,5,Good Place for a Business Trip,The Grand Hyatt is an excellent hotel in the middle of Santacruz very close to the office areas. Despite it being in the middle of the busy surroundings the size of the property takes you away into a quiet place where you can easily relax and concentrate on your work. Food selection is great and staff is very helpful - same place next time!
3306,Nature_traveller2309,4,Great stay,Stayed here for a night as there was a family function in the Hyatt ballroom...they have got a huge ballroom with very professional staff and nice service...food is very good at Hyatt...love the lobby and the entrance...rooms are ok not that big enough...breakfast is amazing here
3307,aanya k,5,A comfotable stay,"We opted to stay here for a few nights due to renovation work being carried out at our residence. The stay here is really comfy. Only thjng we dint like was there was no scope of sun light or day light falling in our room. Which can be a bummer if you have a extended stay. But otherwise the stay, food and atmosphere was pleasant to spend the few nights over. "
3308,jk1012015,5,Business,"Residences Manager was on hand to receive us ensuring our stay was memorable. As we stay in this hotel often, we are known to the team and are looked after very well.  Guest Relations Team, B.Gupte, especially, was very efficient and provided  excellent service. Ms A. Singh was a face of the hotel during our stay. Our sincere appreciation for a job well done and we shall return in not too distant future."
3309,Vishal M,4,Great Stay,"The Grand Hyatt, Excellent property. Location is good except everything is the best. Amongst the Hyatt properties, the Grand Hyatt Mumbai is one of the best property in terms of luxury, service & facilities are concern."
3310,Privnuno,5,Luxury enviroment and great bedrooms and restaurants,We went from Lisbon to participate in World Hosting Days in Mumbai and we found a great enviroment and really nice hotel to events and business meetings.  The rooms were amazing and the envirioment was really relaxing. The 4 restaurants that were present in the Hotel all offered great food and service. Also the localization was good to allow us to visit the impressive city that is Mumbai.
3311,OrthoDoc2016,5,‚ÄúJust Exquisite‚Äù,"It was the first time I stayed at the Grand Hyatt , Mumbai and the experience was truly amazing. It left me wondering why I had not indulged in staying here before. I had booked for two nights and three days stay as I was in Mumbai for a medical conference . On arrival , the hotel has top security and the property is massive. The hotel as such is not surrounded by much .There are no shops that are walkable distance from the hotel , which one can explore. Everything lies within the hotel . The reception area is fast in checking you in and out and very thorough. I was given the room on the 6th floor and the view from the room was just gorgeous. To enter the room they have a trick key card which is a lot of fun if your are not used to it. The room lives upto the oomph the Hyatt‚Ä¶"
3312,joelsyp,5,Great hotel in a not so bad location,"So this might be a hotel closer to the airport, but I've found that it's location is more interesting than most would guess - just take a walk around it.  If you walk our the front and turn right and right again, you go down a really interesting street where you see all sorts of people just living their normal lives, fixing tuk tuks, getting water from the back of lorries in buckets etc. Take the next right and there's lots of little shops to dart in and out of.  Then there's the slum - just on the entrance of which there are some fabulous street food vendors - the best bhaji's I've ever had.  It's a taxi ride though to most of the other attractions, which for me isn't a problem.  I've stayed here for business a few years ago and with my wife for a few days when we finished our‚Ä¶"
3313,SelmaLobo,5,Uncomparable Hospitality!,"We stayed here for 2 nights. Rooms were great, good view too! The service, hospitality, ambience, area of the hotel, housekeeping, fitness area, steam sauce etc were amazing!  I would stay here again anyday and would also recommend it to anyone who goes to Mumbai. "
3314,Satish K,5,"Great place, Kids loved it","This is simply great. I loved it, Kids enjoyed it. Breakfast was fantastic. I will stay here again. If your visiting american consulate this is 15 - 20 mins away (quite close). This visit I looked at other hotels at 5k level and then checked this one there is a huge difference. They really bring a huge value to every extra rupee you spend."
3315,Dilip111,4,Grand Hayatt Stay,"A good Hotel,reasonable services,clean rooms at par with other five star hotels,but nothing exceptional.Location is good,if you are coming from Domestic Airport=About 3 Kms and.About 8 Kms from International Airport."
3316,Vishal Madan,5,Great Hotel with Great food and rooms,The property is very well maintained. The rooms are clean and spacious. The service is great. The breakfast layout is superb. Overall a great hyatt experience. The Cons: Location not that great but you would not consider that after getting a great Hyatt experience.
3317,Devakiashish,4,Brunch!,Awesome spread!  Just need to starve before you get started!!! We could not try not all the cuisines since we didn't have enough time to spend. People from Mumbai will definitely know the time taken to reach but still leave your home early so u get there while they lay the tavle and for you to have a happy afternoon and an awesome beginning to your evening!! Cheers!
3318,Bharat P,4,A hotel with a classy food restaurant,"This hotel is one of my favorite hotels ...and a restaurant like Celini is uncomparable,buratta is a best choice in this restaurant,it's situated In a comfortable location ..easy transportation available near bye ..."
3319,Nani Krishna K,4,"Clean, Hygenic, Hospitality, Spacious, Centrally located","The Hotel has a Clean, Hygenic environment with good Hospitality. A warm reception by staff is worth appreciating. The hotel is spacious and Centrally located to reach our offices. Appreciate the services provided by the management."
3320,Robert S H,5,A very good choice for business hotel-Mumbai,"I stay at this hotel one week in three for business in Mumbai, its an excellent base for a busy schedule. Staff friendliness and support is the key differentiator. Good choice in wide range of dining options"
3321,Kaushik K,5,"Stay at Grand Hyatt, Kalina",We have had an amazing experience during our stay. The staff service is exemplary and prompt. No complaints whatsoever. They have maintained excellent hygiene standards. The hotel has good options for in house dining. The shopping center has a few shops but sufficient to cater to your needs.
3322,SS085,4,Great service and food but charged my credit card twice,Pros The rooms are every clean and spacious. The breakfast has a lot of variety. Service standards are excellent Cons We had already paid by cash but they still charged the credit card that we had presented at the time of check in. So they charged us twice but mistake corrected within a week when we spotted the error and complained
3323,watsonIleDeFrance,4,Great Hyatt journey,"Having to come for job often in Mumbay, this hotel has a lot to offer: friendly staff, spacious rooms, and bathroom, and a superb evening buffet under monitoring of a notorious chef! the hotel is located at some steps from airport, including a shopping arcade. Room service is on time when needed and laundry is perfect.What else to say? I will come back soon I hope."
3324,Arun L,4,"Good service,good rooms,odd location","A regular 5 star hotel :service,ambiance,room,lobby,restaurants,maintenance,swimming pool,all.The shopping centre is deteriorating.The location too is on the weaker side.They should improve upon room location indicators as the the hotel has some 465 rooms and it is rather confusing to locate your room.This hotel could be ideal for weddings as the property has good locations for functions.and the large number of rooms could make the required rooms availability easy."
3325,Seehal S,4,Good Experience Overall,"My wife and I stayed here during mid July 2016. Overall have to say, it was a good experience and well deserves it's 5 stars! The rooms were clean, spacious and well maintained bathrooms, knowledgeable staff and overall good restaurants. The executive assistant to the GM had contacted me before via email to ask our preferences, a surprising but welcome email, which ensured we got the room and certain preference we needed especially the fact my wife was Vegan. Unfortunately, in India, being vegan is tough, they excel at being vegeterian but tend to use a lot of dairy in most of their vegeterian options which are all pre-marinated or part of the ingredients. Nonetheless, we got by OK at the hotel. Ultimately good experience overall and I would definitely only stay here on my‚Ä¶"
3326,Chand B,4,"Stay at Grand Hyatt, Kalina Mumbai","The hotel is very strategically located for all those who have work in Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra, Juhu. It is very near to the domestic and international airport. Located in a quiet lane makes it even better, if one wants to have a quiet walk outside the hotel. The food spread is good anda wide variety of choice of restaurants. The ambience is great. The rates are reasonable compared to others of similar class and brand. A must stay place. I have my own view with respect to the treatment the staff provides to Indian and foreign guests, but with adequate guidance things should improve."
3327,KhaiPg,5,Enjoyed my stay,"A hotel of high standard near the airport. The service was excellent. The staffs that I met, from the Front Desk, restaurants, Spa, concierge and the house keeping were all very friendly and helpful.   The room was comfortable, with most of the amenities available. The only complaint may be the choice of the breakfast, which was almost the same for the three days I was there. "
3328,Paul J,4,Lovely Welome,I visited here on a business trip and stayed for 2 nights. The welcome at the hotel was very pleasant. The room was spacious and well equipped. The hotel staff were very welcoming.  There was a selection of restaurants and bars within the hotel. The breakfast buffet was good and the waiter staff were very friendly.  All in all a good stay.
3329,Anupam G,2,Not-So-Grand Experience,"I had requested a late check out at the time of booking. Upon calling up the hotel, they confirmed it was possible to accommodate my request. However, at the time of check-in it was conveyed to me that the hotel was having full occupancy and such has been it's state since the last one month and there was no way they could do that. Had I been informed this state at the time of the booking, I wouldn't have booked this hotel in the first place as I had a late night flight to catch. Eventually, I had to check in to another hotel in between my other commitments in Mumbai. The hotel was accommodating a large group of guests who were a part of some corporate event. I was put up on the same floor with them. This group of people were extremely loud and used to shout at each other and run‚Ä¶"
3330,Sukesh Datt M,5,Excellent place to stay in Mumbai,Very Professional and ideal for Business travel stay. Excellent central location to cover Mumbai across. Food and Service is very good. Rooms are spacious and very clean & tidy. Staff is very courteous and professional. It is a good option for a family and leisure travel also
3331,spguha,5,"Overnight stay @Grand Hyatt, Kalina, Mumbai",My most preferred stay at Mumbai. Rooms are spacious & comfortable. Breakfast has been always good. Very good & helpful staff at reception. Very comfortable stay. Would like to recommend to anyone coming to Mumbai.
3332,Sunil V,5,Pampered with care,"Everyone is present to make yourself feel homely and wanted.  Great breakfast!! The experience is consistent with every trip so far. This is the 10th visit and I have never been dissatisfied.  Great proximity to all the shopping places.  At the same time, its away from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai.  The only downside is non proximity to mass transit.  You do need a car to get to and from the hotel"
3333,ManishDD,5,Very nice hotel.. with the best standards and very attentive staff.,We stayed here for 6 nights and we found this hotel to really look after their guests. From coming out of car and entry to the rooms in less than 10 minutes !!!!! Awesome. The best breakfasts I have ever had a hotel. This hotel hires the best staff available.
3334,Sketchy M,5,Best business hotel ever!,"I prefer this hotel above any other, due to it being the best business hotel ever! Some of the salient features being: 1) They have the fastest check-in procedure, once you have stayed with them for > 2-3 times. Trust me - it can take seconds than minutes many times!  2) Grand Hyatt has a fabulous system, and they proactively remember your last times' staying preferences, even if you have forgotten to mention about them. 3) The staff and the reception comprise of some extremely superior individuals, and together - they form a team, serving with world-class hospitality indeed!  4) My most preferred business hotel ever - in almost every city that I have travelled so far, in India and abroad!"
3335,Brian P,5,Excellent Service each time,I use Grand Hyatt Mumbai regularly over 4 times a year and have been given some excellent service and personal attention to all my needs  Hats off to Slywia Grand Club Mgr and her boss Varun  Staff seem to remember every detail even if you are coming after 4 months great staff at a great organisation- all together a winning combination
3336,Shaan822,4,Convenient Place!,Its was my second stay in this hotel. The hotel is really good for a short stay in Mumbai if you want to be close to the airport. Last time I booked a Club Suite and this time a normal room with Queen Size bed. Very comfortable rooms with cozy decor and an awesome bathroom. Only thing is that be sure you are in another wing if you prefer calm nights. The night I was in the hotel there was a wedding going on and it was really loud music at 3am in the morning that I couldnt sleep. Some rooms on the same floor was allocated to the invitees of the wedding and whole night they were making lots of noise.
3337,cmahesh2117,4,Good hotel,Locations wise nothing to complaint. The front office staff needs to be little more quick in checking and checkout process. Good ambience and food. Surprisingly toilet/washroom  doors don't have locks which is not appropriate.
3338,Tapanagrawal,4,perfect stay,"Right from checkin to room access and all facilities everything is just perfect. Pool is simply awesome. B'fast menu is complete and upto the expectation of kids and adults both. only cons is room size for a family is seems not enough but manageable. overall satisfied , would stay again."
3339,Jedsada J,4,Nice place and good staff,i have been Mumbai on march. the room is very big. in the room there are the fruit in room. the bathroom cannot lock inside. Totally is ok. if there are have the discount promotion i will stay there. Love it
3340,neemso,5,Great visit at the Grand Hyatt... Time was too short,"Had a couple of days at the grand Hyatt. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Great service, clean rooms and public areas, professional and attentive staff. Had a great meal at the Italian Restaurant and a good time at the club on the basement.  Only downside would be the area in general. Need a car rode to get to shopping and outside eateries. "
3341,Travelbug5099,5,Lovely Hyatt,"This is how you fall in love!  You walk into this hotel around 20 minutes from the domestic and international airports of Mumbai. You arrive at the check in counter and you are greeted with ""Sir its a pleasure to see you again after such a long time"". I mumble (yes I was here a couple of years ago with my family). ""Sir, I am upgrading you to a club room"". I walk into my room un-escorted as its beyond midnight in Mumbai and its cloudy with a chance of thunder showers. Spells like a block buster or an old Hitchcock thriller. The room is immense for a single person. It has a balcony. I am told that the shutters open in the balcony. Maybe the single pleasure of smoking in this world. I open the shutters and behold. I am aghast. Honestly, I am rarely left speechless and this is one‚Ä¶"
3342,Anurag D,5,Great Hotel with a perfect location,"I have been staying at the Grand Hyatt for past few months and I must admit that the team there is excellent and takes excellent care. It has some nice restaurants especially the Italian restaurant which serves authentic Italian Cusine and is run by an Italian Chef . The Location works just fine as it is near the Airport and kind of Centre of the South Mumbai , Andheri , Thane and the Navi Mumbai which are the main business hubs"
3343,Mahmoud Y,4,Good,It is good place to visit . Very clean hotel with very helpful staff . The room is sufficient enough to stay . The restaurant prepared a very fantastic food. I was in business trip and we reserve a business meeting room and it was very professional and the services was also professional from the business staff.
3344,cheehsungm,4,Satisfied Customer,"Was welcomed with an upgrade suite on my first visit. Loved all the food in the restaurants namely; SOMA, China and 57. The hotel employees are very warm and love their hospitality too. Will definitely be returning to stay with them again."
3345,Aarti K,4,Lovely Stay!,"Lovely Hotel, Very friendly and helpful staff ..  I stay here often, so it feels like a second home to me. Good location. The rooms are nice, comfortable and clean. And I must make a special mention about Neha at the front  desk who is very helpful and sweet. Overall it has always been  a wonderful experience staying at the The Grand Hyatt."
3346,Chandeeswar G,5,Delightful stay at Grand Hyatt,Being in proximity to Airports (both domestic & International) provides not only convenient stay but also comfortable one. It's brunch and other facilities are phenomenal.  Staff  is courteous and helpful.
3347,Roger F,4,Great Hotel!,"Excellent hotel with great rooms. Has all the comfort that one needs to relax and just enjoy. Just stayed one night had a flight the next day and they were kind enough for me to extend my check out by 3hrs.  I only ate at the restaurant once for breakfast..excellent spread. All that you can think of is there. Little pricey but worth it.  Their room service menu has a lot of options but just exorbitantly priced. I understand it's a 5 Star hotel but anything above Rs 500 for dal tadka just beats me.   Anyway overall great hotel and good customer service. I would have rated it 5, -1 for the pricey menu. :)"
3348,vijayjamwal,5,Great Hotel and Amazing Experience,"Love the overall ambience and experience of stay. Good options for food and amazing courtesy by staff. Lot of things within hotel to enjoy from bar to chinse food, pool etc. Located centrally and near to lot of good places"
3349,Canucks301,5,Very nice hotel and superb service,"I was on a business to Pune and stopover on Mumbai and stayed at Grand Hyatt just for the night before catching the flight again next morning. I have arranged for hotel transport to pick up and drop off to the hotel which if you are on a business trip it is much safe and faster then trying to catch a cab. The driver was very nice who picked me up at the airport after midnight and next day when I went to the airport at around 8 am it's the same driver, such a hardworking guy. Back to the hotel itself it was big and again the service I received at the reception as well as the attendant who carry my baggage to the room and introduce all the amenities etc was first class.

3351,Apurva58,5,An exquisite property,"This must be my 5th or 6th stay at this hotel over a period of last 7-8 years. Every time a stay here this hotel does not fail to impress me.   They have maintained the property with love and care. One finds everything mint new.  The construction with dark cream marble is excellent and lasting. The internal room plan is superb so that you feel you are in a home bedroom and not a hotel. Bathroom door opens wide, wardrobe in the bath room, separate lavatory in bathroom, excellent tub and shower, fresh new towels and the list goes on and on. No stopper on bathroom door though.   Service is better than many five star hotels abroad.  Art installations in the lobby are worth spending your time studying.   I would love to stay here again and again."
3352,vikas a,1,Disappointed from service of grand hyatt.,This grand hyatt journey was very annoying and specially because of prathmesh who missguided us during breakfast. He told us to go to another restaurant for breakfast where the personal event was going on. And then we had to come back to the same restaurant for the breakfast and this was very awkward and embarrassing for us.
3353,Sudipto G,5,EXCELLENT SERVICE IS IN DNA OF Grand HYATT,I found excellent service in DNA of Grand Hyatt.  Each and every staff woks like a well oiled engine to give their best customer centric experience to the guests.  Kudos to the Management Team of for delivering highest level of hospitality.
3354,Abrahan Carpio,5,Last visit,"Excellent experience with luxury and relax environment adding very good food cousin. clean rooms, easy check in and check out process offering professional services. Very good location with easy entry and out access."
3355,Nos qui sumus,3,Beware the hotel car service,"This was my second stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai. The hotel is modern, fairly efficient with large comfortable rooms. It is also (relatively) close to the airport.   My main gripe this time around was with the hotel‚Äôs car service.If it weren't for this, I would give them 4 stars. First, some of the cars (or at least the one I ended up with) was pretty beaten up. Second, despite asking multiple times for a different car and getting positive acknowledgements every time (‚ÄúYes, Sir, not a problem‚Äù), I still ended up with the same car. (Funnily enough, there were two other (empty) hotel cars parked next to the one assigned to us, so I suspect it wasn‚Äôt an issue of availability). Lastly, to add insult to injury, it was very cheeky for the hotel to try to squeeze another 30 mins on‚Ä¶"
3356,Amit N,5,One of the best overall experience,"Grand Hyatt is lovely place to stay at in Mumbai. The staff is very caring and compassionate, Hygiene is always the first priority of the hotel and the ambience is awesome. My stay was made very comfortable by the staff as each and every request was considered and completed. I wish them all the luck."
3357,Ramya B,5,A very peaceful stay,Love the hotel and the Five East restaurant. The food and staff are attentive and caring. I would recommend a visit for sure! My dinner and breakfasts at Five East was very satisfying. Good spread. Special mention to the wonderful Iftar special dishes for dinner. All in all a great experience.
3358,Sourin R,5,Excellent stay in Jun 2016 with family,"We stayed here from 9th thru 13th Jun and enjoyed our stay immensely. The restaurants in the hotels are exceptional and Fifty five East serves an exceptional breakfast spread with attentive staff on hand. Ronny and Sanket took care of us during breakfast and our dinner with friends and relatives and went above board with their service. the only con will be the lack of closet space in the room for families, since the rooms are designed for a single business traveller, in mind. The gym and the pool facilities are excellent as well adn the art displayed around the hotel is simple stupendous. Had an awesome experience with our stay and will choose this hotel for all future stays."
3359,Pankaj M,5,Amazing Hospitality,Entire staff in Grand Hyatt is very well behaved and amazingly trained to cater to the guest requirements. They always travel an extra mile to take care of your needs and give you a home like experience.
3360,Subramanian N,5,Great hotel for business trips,"I have been using Grand Hyatt during several of my business trips.  They have clean rooms that are quiet and nice.  The staff there are very courteous and nice.  They are very helpful.  The restaurant, particularly the breakfast spread is awesome."
3361,Mike R,5,2 weeks in Bombay!,"Best Hotel I've ever stayed in throughout Asia thus far! Everyone was extremely helpful (some working for tips) but most of the staff were just pleasant and eager to satisfy. It is also very close to the airport for convenience sake. After the long flight, all I wanted to do was get to a soft bed..  The rooms were large, very well maintained, comfortable beds, and offered any bathroom consumables you may have forgotten behind. Drinking water in India is obviously a big issue as well. If I remember correctly, I had about 10 bottles of water scattered through the room which would be restocked daily, so that was reassuring for my first Indian excursion.  Overall the hotel looks amazing inside and out. It is pretty large and worth the time to wander around and investiage :) It is‚Ä¶"
3362,Mujahid A,1,GET PROFILED AND HARASSED FOR FREE,"Absolutely the low point of my travel to India. I have stayed in over 10 hotels in India and this over priced hole takes the cake. I was profiled because of my nationality and religion. No regulation or requirement was sighted. They wanted to only hold my passport and required a photo taken, yes very similar to going to jail."
3363,sugan r,5,Hospitable and Pleasant,Beautiful stay perfect conclusion too a trip in India with lovely hospitable helpful kind staff that  are efficient and pleasant too all guests.  Food was excellent and efficiently served all times.   Clean and warm ambience perfect stay.  THANK YOU WAS MUCH APPRECIATED.  SUGAN SOUTH AFRICA 
3364,Mike G,4,Research Director,I stayed at Grand Hyatt Mumbai for second time as I enjoy the service quality and friendly staff specially at restaurants. I had a surprise by two of the staff sundhakar nakte and sarfraz being served Indian traditional ice cream although it was not in the menu and they had to get it from another restaurant. Showed me a good example of going extra miles. 
3365,Dheya_T,4,Very nice,"Very nice and large hotel if you want to stay away from city Centre . It's only half an hour from the airport which is a major advantage. I think that it's primarily suitable for business travelers. The hotel has many outlets or restaurants, health club , etc . A small but luxurious shopping mall is attached to the hotel .Recommend hotel "
3366,hemashah,5,Fading Glory Still Shines Bright,"This used to be a prime hotel when the Santacruz airport was the primary hub for domestic flights. It is still a very nice hotel. And you can get really good value. However, on my most recent trip it seemed that the energy was flagging just a wee bit. You had to look around for a bell boy to come lug your suitcase up the flight of stairs to reception, the  staff were not as well trained and attentive as I remember them from previous trips. The facilities are still world class and most of the time so is the service. Still the prime location for large business meetings."
3367,SHAWN K,5,GRAND IS REALLY GRAND,"The hotel is one of he best hotel that i have ever stayed . The room service Is excellent and the hygiene of the room Is superb . We were staying with an infant and due to some emergency we needed a child specialist. The Doctor was there in no minutes.  The cuisine of this hotel was superb. If you travel to Mumbai , this is the best place to stay in. The staff is very helpful and courteous. I would say 10 out out of 10. You need some thing and they have it."
3368,ah_foodie,5,Superb property with amazing view!,"Grand Hyatt Mumbai has been one of the best hotel properties visited so far. Located close to the BKC area, this hotel is ideal for business travellers. The property is huge with large spacious rooms. Would recommend to opt for the rooms facing the inner courtyard and waterfall. This inner courtyard is the highlight of the property for its fantastic view, especially when lit up at night! The hotel staff is extremely courteous and efficient. The breakfast spread is vast with multiple delectable options, both veg and non veg. The food being tasty is an added bonus! Definitely looking forward to a repeat stay at this amazing property at the earliest! "
3369,Premierlalit,5,great stay,"it was a business stay. Food was average. overall service was very good . if you are smell sensitive the perfumed smell from the Air condition vent will give you migraine. here is a tip: if you want to have good discount, just go to hotel near to reception ask for phone booking desk, a few steps away find the phone booth , book the same hotel at a much cheaper price , is'nt it wonderful.  Happy stay. cheers"
3370,historycling,5,Business trip,"The word Hyatt keep itself alive at Grand Hyatt, Mumbai. The starred hotel has a nice entrance. The staff at reception are ever helping and prompt. you need not to wait for ages to check in or check out. The paintings and the art work (modern art) in the lobby is mesmerising. The rooms are well laid with spacious baths.The swimming pool is the cleanest I have seen and beautiful. Above all , the variety of food either for breakfast, dinner is jaw dropping especially at fifty five east."
3371,202vineetb,5,Perfect Business Hotel,"This hotel has great memories for me as I have had some of my most successful business meetings, conferences and deals here. It's a great place. :-)  First-up, the location of the hotel is very convenient. It is like 10 minutes from the Mumbai domestic airport and about 20 minutes from the international airport. It is also close to business districts like Bandra-Kurla (BKC) and even Andheri in some ways.   The rooms are simple and business-like. No frills but comfortable. They could definitely do well by installing some bigger face-mirrors in their brown-tiled bathrooms. The view from the rooms is not very exotic. It is mostly the road outside or the inner atrium, which is not very attractive.  The restaurants are mind-blowing! The chinese (China Room I think) as well as‚Ä¶"
3372,InfinityOn,5,Awesome hotel close to airport,The hotel is situated close to airport. The rooms are spacious with high speed WiFi and bathtub. It has a large executive table and HD TV. The food was delicious with variety. The swimming pool was however not deep. The gym and steam rooms were great. 
3373,gsvh83,5,Wonderful place to stay near the airport,Stayed there in Jun 2016. Got a monsoon deal for a room. Fantastic place and great buffet in 55 east restaurant. The sunday brunch was fantastic but pricey. They have a 50% discount on them for reservations made earlier.
3374,Anup Ghosh,5,HYATT STANDS BY ITS NAME - GRAND,"If you need to experience a Royal treatment during your stay at Mumbai, there is no better place than Grand Hyatt. Close to the Airport (10-20 Mts), there is no better place to stay. They got over 500  rooms  and Check in and Check out in a Jiffy as they value your time. The staff is extremely courteous, the food -just amazing and every guest gets his or her share of personal attention. Its got a beautiful Swimming Pool, Spa, Jacuzzi and a very spacious Gym. I stay in various Five stars all over India as well as abroad, due to the nature of my work -  I have no doubts that this Hotel is by far the BEST."
3375,Carole D,5,Excellent stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"Had a very pleasant and comfortable stay at Grand Hyatt hotel Santacruz East, Mumbai. The room was very clean and over comfortable.  The food was of topmost quality and the staff were all courteous and helpful. Enjoyed the Grand Hyatt hospitality and look forward to staying there again."
3376,Avinash Yadav,5,Nixe hotel to visit,We had enjoyed a lot in this hotel nice staff and service of the hotel .the food we eat was good and Delicious .the rooms of the hotel was good and we had a great time spend. Nice time spend in this hotel 
3377,Kat A,3,"Thin walls, small rooms.","Maybe I was lucky, I got a connecting room and I could hear when my neighbour is watching TV, when he coughs and when he's taking a shower. Because of this, I did not sleep well, and did not feel rested at all.   Front desk seems short staffed, or they are just really slow, because the queue is usually very long.  That one stay was my last stay by choice."
3378,Magdalena T,5,Great place in Mumbai,"Very friendly and attentive staff, comfortable rooms, good variety of food and excellent spa. I come there always when I am in Mumbai, over last 6 years. The location is good because it is quite close to the Airport however Mumbai attractions are a bit more far away."
3379,Raman N,5,Survey of Grand Hyat,"All is well n good , Excellent ,i enjoyed being at GraND HYAT AND Overall stay was Nice , Food Quality at Breakfast was Superb and Service at Bfast was Awesome , love that all, In future i will be visitin g , i will be staying at Grand hyat only"

Great food, very friendly & courteous staff, amazing hospitality ... Now I can confidentially say that it feels like I'm in my 2nd Home ... Keep up the excellent work team Grand Hyatt !"
3381,Ravi A,5,Very good hotel,Value for money and great staff / services.The only thing I'd have preferred is that they had faucets at the toilet to ensure that Indian guests also are comfortable. No point in pleasing only the western folks.
3382,Gulam ali G,5,Excellect Stewards Staff in the Hotel Soma,The hotel has best service faculty. All the stewards there are too good. I was happy withe the service of MR. Asim Shaikh. He is one of the best who served me and i m so glad with his service that i will visit you hotel again and again and would like to get service from him. I will also refer my near and dear friends & relatives to your hotel and will also tell them about your excellent hospitality.
3383,Gaurav K,5,A lovely stay,The resort is beautifully placed to be centrally connected to town and subburn mumbai city. The rooms are cozy and nice. The food is nice. Enjoyed the sunday brunch which is a wide spread of awesomely tasteful and yummy food. Prices could be better but nonetheless a good place. 
3384,Parvin G,4,Ups and Downs,"Hard to rate, because the hotel, rooms, and the location are great. However, some staff are conspicuously untrained in dealing with guests. Breakfast is awesome. China house restaurant is one of the best. Soma is average!"
3385,Preeta V,4,BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY WITH VAST EXPANSE,A nice hotel with vast space and lot of greenery. very courteous staff. Pool is only 4 ft which didn't make swimming an enjoyable experience. Vegetarian food options was limited. Authentic southindian food was could improve lot on taste. Spa area looked extremely good.Cleanliness and location is a plus point
3386,Nlekhadia,5,Very Nice Hotel for leisure or business trip,"Excellent location by means of its silent, wonderful breakfast. Ask for the swimming pool view which practically every room has it. Big rooms, modern fittings in bath room. A nice romantice get awau for couples. Children friendly."
3387,Travelfreak2401,5,Excellent hospitality,The hotel is huge. Rooms are not that spacious but very well maintained. The restaurant food is totally amazing...the staff is very very generous and helpful...loved the lobby area...spa services are great. Close to the airport and in the centre of Mumbai....
3388,saurabhgambhir,5,Indeed Grand !,"As the name suggests , the hotel is grand in every sense of the word. It has an inventory of 500 plus rooms to start with, and this is where the services of this hotel pass the litmus test with finesse, as even after just being another number in the hotel, the personalisation and attention to detail is immaculate.  Lovely modern rooms , very typical of Hyatt with all the amenities and space. The pool is extremely tranquil and the f n b is pretty good too.  However my review would be incomplete if I don't mention the club lounge - it was indeed the showstopper ! The location and the view is extremely appealing and the personalised service is exemplary!  Kevin at the club lounge was extremely warm and hospitable , and I have no doubts he would go a long way in this industry... He‚Ä¶"
3389,ashim m,5,"Cozy stay, super food","Was here for an event, stayed for 5 days, was a pleasant stay with helpful staff, good food. Must visit the Chinese and the Italian restraunt. They were celebrating an anniversary of the hotel and every hour the hotel staff did a flash mob, quite interesting. The feel of the hotel is very subtle and doesn't make you uncomfortable.  Love this hotel "
3390,Hinal K,5,Best hotel near,"Excellent staff, good location - close to airport, Excellent quality rooms, Not overpriced, excellent amenities, Good family restaurants, lounges and night club in the hotel..!!! Highly recommended for business as well as leisure travel...!!"
3391,Raul110070,5,Well oiled business hotel,"The room was well appointed, neat and big. The cleanliness of the room was par excellence. The bathrooms are huge and well lighted. The hotel is HUGE and is used for many business conferences, so it may be a little intimidating for a leisure traveller. The breakfast buffet was great and efficient. The gym was also big, and i especially liked the separate yoga room which afforded some peace and quiet."
3392,431saritac,5,Grand Hyatt Mumbai - Second Home!,"Exemplary service with great attention to detail. A special shout out to Kevin from the Club Lounge, all the staff at Celini especially Darrell!!!. They were all well informed about the food and drinks and their recommendations were spot on. The went out of the way to make every meal at great experience. We had the pleasure of meeting the chef Alessandro as well! We are looking forward to visiting again. Grand Hyatt is like a second home to us in Mumbai - The Mayekar Family."
3393,zuleica g,3,Expect more...,"We have been at Hyatt Mumbai last March/April to a wedding party. The hotel is beautiful, but the food was average. the overall experience was not what we expected. In the pool there was some really bad smell, don't know if was garbage or something else. The room service was ok, but every time they forgot something (ice, ketchup, etc..). I think the carpet could be more clean, the bed was ok. They have some stores in the lobby, but I expect more in terms of quality and variety. This month my husband is returning to Mumbai but he is going to try another hotel.   The staff was ok. But I think there are better options in Mumbai."
3394,Chaitanya R,4,Perfect place for business or pleasure,I hosted a medical conference at the Grand Hyatt in April. The rooms are very spacious and well equipped. The comforting and welcome atmosphere guarantee a good night's sleep. Food is also above average.
3395,clepsidro,1,Very rude management,We have arrived at the hotel around midnight. The whole check-in process lasted about half an hour and we were spoken in a very rude way and told we have to check out by 7a.m and no breakfast was offered. This was the worse service we have received during our one month stay in India. If you want to meet nice people and stay in nice places you are better off to go for budget accommodation or if you'd like some luxury the Taj is definitely the best.
3396,Madanmohan D,5,Experience at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai,My overall Stay experience at The Grand Hyatt ( Mumbai) was extremely rejuvenating. My family enjoyed the stay and food. The Hotel Ambeince was extraordinary and Staff was very supportive and humble to all guests. Looking forward to visit The Hyatt at Maldives soon incase i get a complete Stay + BF + one meal included at a very good price.
3397,Abhishek1702,5,Weekend at Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"As always, brilliant staff, food and rooms. Love to keep coming back to this hotel. Has got all items checked. There are some fancy in your face decor hotels which are not to my liking. Hyatt mumbai fits the bill perfectly."
3398,Julia,4,Lovely room but far-flung location,"We were given a room at the residences which was a blessing in disguise. The room is like a mini apartment and the kitchen is well-equipped. The only minus point is that Grand Hyatt Mumbai is located quite far from convenience stores, eating places and shopping areas."
3399,Mehul D,5,Excellent Concierge service,"Brilliant hotel. Staff were excellent. I had left my kindle in my room after check-out and was rushing to catch a flight. When i called up the hotel, the concierge (Nikhil) arranged to have it sent to the airport in very quick time before I departed. Great example of going above and beyond."
3400,aldridge11,4,A really nice Business hotel,"my views The room and service was excellent, the staff were very helpful indeed. the food was just average. according to me one of the best business hotel in mumbai, the lobby being very spacious and welcoming"
3401,yudh_vir,5,Great stay and service,"Stayed for a day with family here, one of best property in Mumbai. Great room, extreme cleanness, prompt staff and service. I love when staff takes care of kids. Was in club for cocktail hours and the way they served us was so welcoming. Server named Kevin ( forgot his last name ) was so jovial and ready to serve. He even got cookies for kids and they called him "" Kevin Bhaiya"" we stay at many places, however folks who serve us and standard of Hyatt makes a lot difference. This was my 10th stay in Hyatt properties worldwide and this was best one!! "
3402,Aditya M,4,Need higher value for Hyatt Passport members,According to me Hyatt Passport members having corporate tie up with Hyatt need higher value . Hyatt always try to pitch in for Club expereience but should not over do the sales pitch. I would not rate the hotel extremely high given the fact that small things.
3403,HAREESH M,4,Splendid Business Hotel,This is one of the best business hotels in Mumbai with big conference rooms and bid lobby very close to Mumbai Airport. Was there part of a conference and choice of foods are also commendable. Staffs and professional and supportive. Have installed good collection of art works with modern concepts around the common areas.
3404,Rohit J,4,"Grand Hyatt, a grand affair","Stayed at the Grand Hyatt with family. Must say it lives up to its name - its GRAND!! With enormous paintings and sculptures to fountains, its like an oasis in a desert. The location is great if you wish for something near the airport. In the morning it took 20 mins to reach. The area outside the hotel is not so developed but once you're inside, you/re transported to a place of extreme luxury. Rooms are small and modern with open bath and toilets - gets odd if you have a small child with you as there are no locks. Nice pool and other facilities. Huge breakfast spread. Didn't try any other meal here but I'm sure it would be good. Staff is courteous and efficient, though not in the same class as a Taj. A hotel primarily catering to Business - for which it would be perfect."
3405,Warwick A N,4,quick business trip,A high standard hotel close to airport with out having them fyling overhead ( 10 minutes by car now with new roads ) great quality food & service. Good gym and spa center attached to hotel. A good place to meet for business

Resturent are great.Food is mouthwatering.All types of food is great taste and delicious.Dinner was awesome and lots of varieties of Food.Pool side sitting arrangement is really peaceful. Overall awesome place in Mumbai Property wise aswome.

3409,chandra s,5,Great piece of property,I was there with my family for a night halt. I had nothing much to do in Mumbai but my kids loved to go around the property. It had nice gardens and great art corners.   The room was pleasant and large sized bed were the best part. and it made my day.  It was my first stay at a 5 star hotel I was a little apprehensive of the rates and would have loved if someone would introduce the pool and sports facilities.
3410,Alleon1986,5,Incredible Stay,"My stay at the hotel truly surpassed all other experiences at any other five star. The staff were courteous, unintrusive and efficient.  The room itself was incredibly spacious and very comfortable.  It's unfortunate that I couldn't spend more time exploring the facilities at the hotel during my stay."
3411,camelgurgaon2014,5,Overnight business trip,"From the meet and greet at the airport to when we left, it was superb all the way. The most exceptional staff I have ever experienced - nothing was too much trouble and being senior didn't mean you couldn't carry a guest's luggage.Information about amenities was extensive and all were very friendly. Congratulations on the staff training! Food was great and varied. Lounge was a pleasure with great hospitality. Pool was a bit warm due to the weather!"
3412,Hugh_G659,5,Wonderful Caring Team,"I have just returned from a trip to India, staying at the Grand Hyatt. During my stay I unfortunately became ill. The whole hotel team could not have been more caring. A doctor was organised. The medicines fetched from the pharmacy. Even a visit to my room by the assistant manager with some roses. They have gained one very loyal guest."
3413,Matthew H,4,Great Hotel,"Work booked me in to a standard room for 3 nights , there is nothing standard...big rooms, comfy bed , amazing bathroom . I thoroughly recommend staying here if coming to Mumbai.  The food is 10/10, only comment I would say is there are way to many pigeons / birds etc near the pool , and needs to be addressed .   That being said I enjoyed my time and will recommend this hotel to all who travel here .  Regards "
3414,PNJ_18,5,Great experience,"We had very good time with the family in the hotel. The service was superb. Best of all, the range of breakfast items, were too good to explain. There were n number of items you could choose from. Overall, it was beautiful experience staying in this hotel."

3416,Nelly M,5,Jewel in Mumbai,"I went to Mumbai with my husband to speak at a meeting held at this hotel. The place is stunningly beautiful, the lobbies and rooms have the feel of a modern museum as there is fine art everywhere. It is huge and spacious with sky high ceilings and multiple restaurants all fantastic. This is a true gem in the center of Mumbai. I'd stay here again if ever in this city, truly spectacular, and the service superb.  "

The reception area was spacious and well decorated, as were the guest rooms. great shower - always a bonus, and lovely d√©cor. The Indian and Chinese restaurants were superb, with great food choices and service- and breakfast was also very good. The fitness centre was well equipped with plenty of kit to chose from. I will return!"
3421,Parul_Shah,2,Not so Grand :(,"Well it was my birthday and my thoughtful husband planned a relaxed day out not too far from home (to save travel time) and so we landed at The Grand Hyatt, 10 mins drive from home.  Our welcome itself was quite disappointing. For a 2 pm check in we were already late by more than an hour, in spite of that they took 30 minutes to give us a room. The excuse given was that the system is down. However, we witnessed them checking in two Japanese gentlemen and one more European couple. After good 40-45 minutes, we were in the room.  Next, it being my tea time, I called room service for some tea and snack. I was shocked when instead of confirming the order the guy asked me 'How will you be paying for this?' . At the reception, they had already taken the credit card details and verified‚Ä¶"

3423,landor466,3,"Many times visitor, first time reviewer","In my 25 or so years of coming to India I have stayed in many different hotels and at this hotel about about a dozen times. Over the years I have experienced the gentle decline of this hotel and many other like it around the international airport. When first opened, a discounted night at this hotel was over 300 dollars, today it is about 120. Does that tell the story all by itself? In part. See this hotel as probable has one of the highest number of employees dedicated to service you than any western hotel you will find anywhere but the quality of the service is very much poor. 3 people hang around the breakfast coffee machine to serve you a coffee by an automatic coffee maker, but you can't get the attention of the dozen of so servers because they are hanging around the coffee‚Ä¶"
3424,romeo2305,5,Very good,Stayed for business..highly recomened for the Service the food and the clean plus...  spacious rooms.locations is also a plus.T ried out the Celini restourant and it is a good choice for an Italian abroad!
3425,Pallav J,5,Relaxed Time,"Stayed here for three nights. Very comfortable, courteous staff. Their breakfast buffet has an extensive menu catering to people from all over the world.Has excellent restaurants especially their Chinese restuarant. Will stay again."
3426,Gregg H,5,Highly recommended,Stayed here for a very quick 1 night stay last week. Only had about 13 hours in the hotel but was very impressed  Rooms were large and well decorated and had a very comfortable bed. The staff were great and nothing was too much trouble  For breakfast the choice was huge! And ranged from western to Indian choices. They even have live cooking stations as well as the traditional buffet  Very convenient for the airport which is about 10 minutes drive away. Ideal if you want to be close to the airport without staying in an actual airport hotel  The hotel was quite far away from the sights of Mumbai so wouldn't be a great choice for longer sightseeing stays but very good if you have a night in Mumbai before an onward flight
3427,axbisw2,5,Nice and Pleasant Stay,"I have stayed in Grand Hyatt on a official trip. My office was in BKC- Bandra and the hotel had a pick up and drop facility to my office premises. The room where I stayed has all the comforts and nicely maintained. From the restaurant standpoint, SOMA which mostly deals with Indian cuisine offers you limited cuisines but nice food. Fifty Five East which is another restaurant ,has buffet and has range of varieties .  This Hotel is spacious and close to Airport as well as located in the heart of the city. Hotel has been managed by  professional staffs and they made my stay very pleasant."
3428,abhay_adhav,5,Grand Hyatt,"As the name it is truly Grand ! Overall my experience was great. very good hotel facility ,Helpful staff, tasty food ,good ambiance. The breakfast was really wonderful! One of the best star hotel. Excellent place to stay"
3429,Mark W,4,Great rooms!,"Cant say it was the best, or the food was delicious but on an average a decent place to stay. I personally felt The staff was too formal (could help you out with anything) but could not create a bonding with the customer. Great Security. sadly as a reason of which I had to park my Sports bike (Rental) Behind the hotel itself.  If you are a Bike rider/Have a bike Grand hyatt might not be the place to stay."
3430,Keith M,5,Absolutely Brilliant Oasis in Mumbai,"Loved the hotel - clean, modern, loaded with amenities, great food options, couteous staff. A resort style oasis in the heart of Mumbai. Would strongly recommend for family trips and business too. Close to all travel options."

The food is prepared with care and our needs seemed to be at the heart of what they do. Not all Grand Hyatts are 'grand'. This one is. We are looking forward to our return in June."
3432,634bindum,4,Very pleasant stay,"Clean, decent sized rooms, modern, attentive staff, good food, quiet, spacious entrance areas, good room layout, good gym.   I would stay there again.

Common areas beutifully decorated, service in all aspects good, and inclusive a ATM machine.   I had no time to enjoy the great swimming pool and SPA ! Hopefully will come again"
3438,roamingShailendra,5,Comfy and extemely courteous staff,"Its really a worth spending for short relaxing holidays. Has all sorts of indoor facilities needed for relaxation.  We visited for celebrating 3 months of our baby and having a little time off our big change through pregnancy.  The rooms are big and staff also provided us with a big crib, that helped a lot.  Breakfast was also good, they had smoked salmon and alphonso mangoes, which we enjoyed a lot.  Could not explore much on other fascilities, since we had baby, but all we experienced was nice."
3439,surbhit592,2,Extremely Cold Service,"I stayed for 2 nights at a Club room and the service was extremely cold.   - Post checkin - nobody escorted me from the club floor to the room, I was given the keys  and asked to find my room in the maze  - On the second day, I return to my room for a shower and find that the bath gel has not been replaced. The house keeping put the cap on the half empty bottle and placed it back. I called house keeping and got a response that they dont replace soap unless one asks!!!!!!! While checkout - I told the person on the desk, I was told that I will received a feedback email and I could put my complaint there. Guess what - I havent got that email yet!!  -Post checkout, I was walking out to the porch with my suitcase. There were 3-4 staff standing and the door. Not a single sole that‚Ä¶"
3440,Dean C,3,Beautiful hotel. Watch out for their limo drivers,"As an international business traveler, personal security is first and foremost. The Grand Hyatt has dedicated security staff, luggage x-ray machines, and explosive sniffing dogs. Once inside the hotel compound the staff was extremely attentive and prompt. In-hotel restaurants were good. Gym (which is important to me) was more than adequate. The only concern I had was the limo service back to the airport, the driver scammed me into stopping off at a souvenir store in an attempt to buy something. I didn't fall into the trap and promptly left. Com'on guys, all I want to do is get to the airport. Don't try to sell me anything."
3441,Vishwas T,3,Can improve customer experience,It was an average experience. No where close to outstanding. The staff do not go out of the way to help guests like I have seen in Taj hotels. Hyatt Mumbai - Please dont act stingy in providing the basics toiletries - as available 'ON REQUEST' only. That is pathetic. If you are looking to cut down costs do it in a better way.
3442,GlennBaltimore,5,"Modern, clean, beautiful hotel with great restaurants",I was there to speak at a conference. The facilities were great. Gym is very nice and sizeable. Staff is great. It's a very large hotel. Restaurants delicious and breakfast is fantastic with great selection.  Location is good. Not too far from bridge or airport.
3443,maanz,5,Emergency stopover midnight,After arriving to Mumbai from my business trip I was not able to access my house. All I could think of was going to grand hyatt as I had some points left  The girl who was the supervisor was really helpful . I had safe place to sleep that night and its such a nice place as well
3444,Philipp Muller,4,Great big convention Hotel,"The Grand Hyatt is a great hotel, with great facilities and excellent breakfast. It is close to the airport which is a plus in the chaotic Mumbai traffic, though if you plan to sightseeing Mumbai it is very far away from the main attractions. Staff was very efficient and helpful. We only thought that the hotel is so big that it felt a little ""impersonal""."
3445,ZchewereZ,5,Lovely hotel,"I stayed here with my family for a day over the weekend and what a delight it was! The hotel is very centrally located in Mumbai and thats perhaps one of the most appealing feature of it apart from its very friendly front desk staff. I like people who smile a lot and are kind. And Deepak at front desk did that and was efficient in catering to all our requests. The food at the Italian place is nice but it can get a bit busy sometimes! If you are looking for a bit of quiet, I reckon its best you order in-room dining.  The interiors of the room were well done up! For me and my family, with rooms next to one another, it was a happy time. Thank you Grand Hyatt!"
3446,AF19,4,Wonderful stay,"Really liked this hotel. Wonderful staff and amazing food. Ate at the local and Chinese resturaunts, food was really good. The location also suited me a lot as it as close to the office and some shopping areas that I wanted to go. Couldn't go though üòä would definitely stay again. "
3447,Jaime G,5,Great Hotel with Great staff,This hotel is a great hotel and has such great friendly staff. very beautiful pool and great restaurants inside. Quite close to the airport so it's quite handy for business . However  I was on my own for one day without a car and there was nothing really to do in walking distance so you really need a driver to be able to go somewhere if you are here on a free day. The Sunday brunch in the Fifty Shades restaurant at the hotel was delicious . Highly recommend this hotel .
3448,GomaMahesh,5,Worth of money,Great experience in cheaper rates ... Thanks to TripAdvisor to such a great service at reasonable prices. My advice to people who are going to any good hotel please use TripAdvisor it was definitely help you..
3449,AnuWrites,3,Great venue for business meetings,"Its just the apt place for any business meet, conferences etc. You can also plan a family trip here, but consider the exorbitant '5-star' rates before you plan for a holiday. The services are really good, rooms are clean and well maintained! Very prompt and courteous staff . However, the restaurants are extremely overly priced, charging mainly for the brand, I guess! There are no other restaurant nearby where you can go and grab a quick meal. Complimentary breakfast was nice."
3450,Harsh Niser,5,1 Night Stay - Great Day,The check in process was quick and had a wonderful stay. The staff is courteous and helpful. Kept things ready on time and i did not have to wait. The food is nice and they prepared a good Jain breakfast. Overall a great & comfortable stay.

3452,Shabeena A,5,A little haven in the midst of Chaos,"As busy as Mumbai can be, grand Hyatt is tucked in to the bustling city at an almost perfect location! Its centrally located, with airport, and all the wonderful art galleries, and shopping experiences just a short drive away! The hotel staff is nice and friendly. All in all, a very pleasant stay at the Hyatt!"
3453,bmorehappy19,5,a quiet oasis,"We stayed here for several days during a trip to Mumbai. It was a quiet oasis away from the bustle of the city. Our room was immaculately cleaned, and the bathroom was large, clean, wonderful. The gym facilities were spacious, well maintained. The ladies whirlpool was a nice place to relax  We had such a great experience, we came back to the hotel the following week when we returned to Mumbai.  This time we upgraded to the club level. The breakfast and happy hour was delicious, with impeccable service. It did not disappoint and we would definitely return in the future."
3454,Marc P,3,Check your invoice,"Check your invoice to make sure you are not charged with undue expenses. Room are clean . Ask for and internal orientation room if you want to limit street noise and reduce planes noise. On Friday a party was especially noisy until late at night, even up to the 3thd floor. Concerning restaurant, if you are ready to wait and some time to explain twice what you want it is ok for you. Otherwise all things were delicious. We were there last week of April during Mango season. No Mango at all..."
3455,Dawood A,4,The overall experience,"I had a very busy schedule so it was only a very stay at the hotel,  Overall for the  stay, it was excellent and looking forward for a long stay soon. And will surely stay there whwn ever I am in Mumbai"
3456,Sally K,5,Mrs,"I loved everything about the Grand Hyatt..from the nice and clean room, to the amenities offered (the fitness center staff was so helpful) and the waitstaff at the breakfast and dinner buffet ...especially the wonderful service of Vicky and Rodney during our 4 nights there! They are the best! We even got to witness the downstairs being decorated for a beautiful wedding on our last night there. "
3457,Praveen Kumar P,4,Enjoyed my stay except for the check-in process,"Recently stayed here for 3 days when i was in Bombay for a business trip. The hotel is very luxurious and has all the amenities. My check-in process was cumbersome, took me 25-30 minutes to get to my room. The receptionist was offering me all kinds of rooms except for the one i booked which was pretty frustrating :(  The staff were genuinely concerned about my stay, though they'll have to be more efficient. Apart from the stay, the food here is brilliant. They have most of the cuisines and some lip smacking dishes.  Some of the amenities and services provided are charged and will cost you a bomb, for example i wanted to get 2 of my shirts washed, and astonishingly laundry charges 1000 bucks for the same. Still can't figure out why i have to pay 500  rupees for the same :P :D ‚Ä¶"
3458,Alexander G,3,Hyatt standard - you can't do anything wrong,"If you book Hyatt, you get Hyatt. Nevertheless at this stay the service overall declined compared to other stays at the same property. Breakfast could be a bit better.. not much choice if you don't like ""warm"". The club lounge is below standard I would expect from a Hyatt. In my opinion not worth to pay extra for it. Complimentary transport to and from airport is good."
3459,Panguin,4,A good overnight to catch a flight,"I've had dinner there and was told it was a wonderful hotel. So I took the opportunity to check it out.  I'm used to the Leela, which is visible from the airport even. So this was a little far for me. The ride by pre-paid taxi was around Rs1,500 and Rs500 by Meru taxi.  The room is nice and first rate for an overnight. The bathroom was probably the most interesting part of the room. The wardrobe is in the same space as the bathroom that can be closed off.  And because it is away from the airport, it is quiet.  There is nothing touristy around the hotel though. So beware if you are thinking of an extended stay or coming with a significant other."
3460,Noel G,4,Very nice hotel!,"This was my home away from home for 6 days during a recent business trip to Mumbai. It's a very nice hotel and I really enjoyed my stay. On the location, it was close enough to most of my meetings so that was good. However, if you want to take a walk outside the hotel premises there's nothing much to see. The room I stayed in was great. Very clean and nice lay-out. I like everything about the room...the bed, the bathroom, the desk. The food was also very good at the Fifty Five East."
3461,sanjay744,5,Fantastic hotel near domestic airport,"It was a short overnight stay at Mumbai, was departing from General Aviation terminal at Kalina, Santacruz East. Just 5 minutes drive to this terminal. Hotel staff is well trained and courteous, breakfast has a great spread, almost everything one can imagine, from Indian to Japanese. Clean, functional hotel, large spaces, good swimming pool. Will stay again here for sure."
3462,Chris,5,Great Hotel close to the airport,"This is a great hotel close to the airport when you like the big very well managed hotels. We enjoyed our one night there. The room was very specious, comfortable and well fitted, the amenities of the hotel and the service was top standard."
3463,Balbir Singh C,3,Over charging for a phone call.,We stayed in the Delhi Hyatt some time ago and had an excellent experience there and thought we would get the same in Mumbai. The stay in the grand Hyatt was okay but were dismayed to find the charge of ¬£40.00 for making 1 collect call. Because of that would not stay in the Hyatt hotels again.
3464,Phil K,5,Mixing business and pleasure,If you are in Mumbai for a short while and need to not only travel around quickly and smartly then this is a fantastic location and superb facilities. The all-round facilities are superb and access to either airport terminal (domestic and international) is ideal and it is only just off the expressway where you can get  the sea link in to the centre of town.
3465,Paul M,5,India Trip April 2016,The Grand Hyatt is close to Mumbai airport and has all the amenities you would expect of a higher end hotel. However the price is similar to a less featured hotel in  the US. I recoomend this hotel if your staying in Mumbai or just staying overnight before traveling to another city in India
3466,Ersin E,4,Airport transfers,"I have stayed at Grand Hyatt for several timesi but unfortunately my last stay was not OK. I had issues with airport transfers which are really critical and not only once. While travelling to Mumbai, I was informed that my airport pickup was not confirmed by the hotel. So I phoned to the hotel from istanbul airport to get a transfer confirmation.  For a domestic travel, I was charged extra amount for being transferred to the domestic airport (this is the first time I'm asked for extra charge for airport transfer in Mumbai).  And on my return from a domestic flight the same evening, although my pickup was confirmed nobody from the hotel showed up. I called the hotel number but could not even get info. Had to took a taxi to the hotel, besides shared my trouble with the front‚Ä¶"

3468,shulank,5,Excellent Hotel!,Grand hyatt is one of the best hotels i have come across. The staff is very cooperative and the food too. The morning buffet was excellent with so so many varities. Had an excellent stay there and nice service.
3469,anandsaklecha,4,Class but now with mass,I had been there after a long time last week. It's a great hotel with nice hospitality. The rooms are good size with views. The breakfast was good having lot of options for vegans as well. But the hotel was on high rush and it was people everywhere. 
3470,Noopur R,1,Terrible hotel - security and safety issue for women!!,"Last Friday I stayed in this hotel. The staff very kindly gave me an early check in which was very much appreciated. However, that was the only good thing about the hotel. To my utter shock, someone opened the door and entered my room while I was sleeping. Inspire of double locking my room from inside - someone barged in to my room and returned only nice I shouted. This hotel has serious security issues - unbelievable for a 5 star property. When I complained, the receptionist said she has raised a complain and get back to me. However, there is no response from their end till now. Extremely disappointed!!"
3471,Nimma B,5,"awesome hotel, awesome stay -- highly recommended!","i was in mumbai for business for a quick two day trip and stayed at the grand hyatt. my stay was really great -- a beautiful and impressive hotel from the amenities, comfort of rooms and the quality/ selection of cuisine/ food available at their various restaurants. the breakfast spread served each morning was a great start the day, plus i'd bring my laptop with me -- as i'd hop on the wifi for a few minutes to crank through work emails after breakfast. i highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to visit mumbai."
3472,Flyer641563,1,Leisure,Awful experience....booked a suite ..was promised few things...after checking in the commitment changed...had to deal with an arrogant manager named Sylvia...who actually could not fix it but did show her arrogance....will never recommend this hotel or stay in it post this awful experience....
3473,martinsarahhh,5,Business in Mumbai,"Grand Hyatt staff are extremely helpful and welcoming. A truly positive experience. My room was very comfortable, quiet and clean. The lobby is splendid for a drink and to read a book. Staff are very helpful to help you to organise trips to see the sights too. I will definitely be returning."
3474,Siddharth S,5,Outstanding. Grand in every sense.,"This was my second stay in Hyatt properties. Earlier I stayed in a 4 star property of Hyatt and while doing the booking for 5 star Grand Hyatt, I was skeptical about the value. But Oh boy, how wrong I was, It was worth every single penny. There is a reason why it was named Grand. Right from the moment you make entry , you will feel grand. Amazing hospitality, Staff is quick , Smart and very helpful. Room were big and properly managed, everything inside room is Flawless. This property has a Shopping plaza inside it, only for guests. Every inch of it make you feel the difference of Grand and normal decor. This property is quite close to Mumbai Domestic terminal (roughly about 9km). Unless you are not on a tour to Mumbai , you can book this property blindly. ***** in every single‚Ä¶"
3475,shefezworld,5,Truly Grand!,"The hotel truly deserves the name. The foyer features expanses of marble and is huge. There artifacts and sculptures kept in the lobby area are magnificent. I was upgraded to the grand executive suite and the room was excellent. Massive hall, comfortable bed room and classic amenities. The room had it all.  The hotel staff is extremely courteous and professional. The restaurants are flavorful and serves various cuisines. My personal favorite is ""Celini"" we tried sea food pizza, which is off the menu but the chef were more than happy to accommodate our request.  I was only here for a short visit but loved the hotel. Excellent and highly recommended."
3476,mot29,5,"Well taken care of, comfortable","This was a quick trip to Mumbai -- sort of a mileage run plus on a very good business class fare. The stay was 3 nights total -- the first 2 booked into a Grand Suite King which came with lounge access and an airport pick-up, the third was a free night from my Hyatt credit card.  The hotel let me keep the suite for the third night although the free night only covers standard rooms. Separate bed room and living room on the 4th floor.  Comfortable bed, lots of mineral water, lots of big towels and nice toiletries. The room came with lounge access -- I used the lounge for 2 breakfasts and one evening reception.  Nice spreads at all of them, the hot breakfast entrees were different each day and included both western and Indian choices, which was quite nice. Friendly staff. The hotel‚Ä¶"
3477,Magdalena B,4,Good experience,"I would recommend this hotel, good location - close to the airport. Overall, the stay was pleasant, very good concierge services although a bit slow service at the breakfast. Additional incorrect costs were added to my bill (to both mine and my friend's bill) - so check before paying."
3478,Livethejourneyalways,5,A great stay,"Grand Hyatt is a great hotel to stay for business or pleasure. Situated at a very apt location, the food, the ambience, the rooms are just what you would expect from a Hyatt. The staff were cordial and service was also good.  What works is that the hotel is pretty close to the airport and hence helps you beat the Mumbai traffic."
3479,ShipraBansal,4,"All well, except the smell","As soon as we reached the hotel, there was a 'fishy' smell to greet us. Not too welcoming! But once inside the hotel, its all smooth sailing. We were quickly checked-in and told about an upgrade to a Club room which included breakfast and unlimited drinks & snacks in the evening at the Club lounge. We took them up on the offer and it was a great stay. Nice, decent sized, clean room, wide room service menu & a choice of restaurants for fine dining. Excellent pillows & bedding. Special mention to Jyoti at the reception who took very good care of us. This was  my husband's third stay in the hotel and we are definitely going back."
3480,konikac,5,Great Experience,It is a hotel which is most conveniently located in Mumbai. Easy to move around to any part of Mumbai. Great food and service as always. Room availability could be a problem sometimes given it is a very busy hotel.

3482,jfkowallace,5,Fantastic,We stayed in the Grand Hyatt and Hyatt regency in Mumbai and they were both fantastic. On arriving in India and on our way home. I Highly recommended this group of hotels. We also stayed in a park Hyatt in Chennai which was delightful. The hotels all had interesting art collections. I was travelling with 2 teenage daughters. We arrived incredibly early as our flight was early and it was a very quick journey from the airport. There is a 24 hour cafe where we had some tea and reception gave us a lovely room as soon as one became available. At about 7 am. This was really apreciated.
3483,Laurent R,3,A questionable quality/price rate,I stayed in this hotel during a business trip and spent a week-end there. The Grand Hyatt is the five stars hotel but is it a reason to propose a double express for 650Rs (10USD). The Chinese restaurant is also very expensive.... Value for money is not there.

The staff are very friendly and will always greet you with a smile. The rooms are clean, spacious and airy with floor to ceiling windows. The only thing that I did not like about the room was that the bathroom did not have a proper door, this meant it was very noisy every time anyone used the bathroom. Conventional doors would block out noise and be preferable. The room service was excellent, the food and drinks were brilliant. The breakfast was delicious, plenty of fresh choices.

In-Room dining service is terrible. Got the food after 1 hour 15 minutes. While following up with the in-room dining service, they disconnected the call in-between without giving a response. At last they provide the reason ""we have huge crowd today"""
3493,Puneet_Khanna,4,excellent hotel in Mumbai,the Grand Hyatt hotel is a excellent property in the close vicinity of Mumbai airport and also close the business district like BKC. Hotel has some of the best restaurants in town. The chinese restaurant is unique and offers cuisine which is very distinctive in taste. Should be a must try if you are staying at Hrand Hyatt.
3494,Tom M,5,"They don't call it ""Grand"" for nothing.","In my opinion, this is one of the best Hyatt hotels in the entire chain. Located out near the airports, this property has an expensive open lobby, that is cool and quiet on even the hottest hectic days of April and May. The rooms are large and the beds comfortable.. Pay up for the club floor, as the lounge has wonderful breakfast and snacks throughout the day. Wonderful restaurants with real authentic Italian food. Stay here, and let me know if you disagree."

3496,stluciahoneymoon,3,Not what I expected,"I waited to review since I was so disappointed with the city I didn't want to take it out on the hotel.  By the way I would rate the city a 0 of 5.  Stay away if you can.  Well overall I was not upset about the hotel but there are the little things that don't make it a 5 star hotel.  If I were to compare to american 4 or 5 star hotels this one certainly has the potential to be one of those.  Most likely a 4 but it is fairly large so it could be a 5 if everything was exceptional. In its current condition though it would only be a 3. The mosquitoes were absolutely horrible.  I understand bugs outside but in the lobby, restaurants, and meeting places.  There were so many they had employees that only did mosquito control, walking around with electric fly swatters during dinner, even‚Ä¶"

I have experienced amazing hospitality, a very warm welcome, care and sense that this hotel acts in accordance with it's policy  giving all their guests joy. Most importantly we were always treated with the highest level of respect. I must say that Fifty Five East restaurant offers best varieties of food I have ever had the pleasure to taste (they have to take responsibility for my current weight:-). Sushi section staff with Mr Ratan was doing everything to meet our expectations and served food that was simply a masterpiece which  has changed our culinary tastes‚Ä¶"
3499,Vishal Maru,3,Decent Luxury with Good Comfort!!,"I had visited this hotel in December first week. The room is good in size. Its spacious enough. The balcony is huge, and you also get a good view. Only issue is the interior of the room. When compared to other five star hotels in the city, the amenities feel not that premium. For example, the washroom is too simple and provides basic things which maybe a 4-star hotel also provides. The list of channels in the television is very limited.   Otherwise, all fine."

The staff are very helpful and nothings a bother for them...the breakfast is just awesome with traditional Indian breakfast to some nice fresh fruit. Rooms are very clean and we had a great pool view which made it even better...we stayed in an club room lounge so we had access to the club lounge happy hour which was great and also the SPA is amazing too (must have a massage there)
3502,KenM62,5,Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"A business hotel that serves leisure customers with equal care. The hotel is blessed with exceptional staff but the Grand Club tops this with service levels at exceptional levels. For thousands of guests to pass through the hotel each week and still for the Grand Club Staff to remember you is exceptional. Retention of staff like Yogesh, Vincent, Rajesh, Kevin, Yogesh and Akshay is of great benefit to the hotel. Good selection of food and beverages and great restaurants.  Look forward to my next visit."

I arrived at around 01:00 (i.e. very late), and the Italian restaurant (with Indian overtones, thankfully!) was still open; if I remember correctly it's 24 hour, which was very helpful. Food was good, especially given the hour, though on the expensive side.  The club level of the hotel was pleasant, though as other reviewers have noted, there are people awake at all hours, which can make it a little noisy, though that wasn't really a problem.

3506,MinKL,1,"Good hotel, but very noisy on club levels","I stay regularly at this hotel and usually at the club floor. But although there are signs requesting people to be quiet after 8pm, it is very noisy, especially if your room is near the lounge area. You then suffer not only from the open setup between floors, but also of all people walking in and out of the lounge. Interestingly the staff sitting at their desks just outside the lounge make most of the noise.  On some occasions the hotel has parties. Even though these are on lower ground level, the music is very present in any of the rooms on level 1 in that particular wing, this is a club floor. Strange considering that the club floor is the more expensive area of the hotel. Most other hotels have these floors at the higher levels, far way from potential disturbances. Anyhow,‚Ä¶"
3507,whokickmydog,5,Now this is 5 Star,"I night stay end of March 2016. Wife and 2 young kids. Check-in was so slick and everyone so polite, welcoming and smiling. My family was checked in by Shruti. I did not realise when booking that breakfast was not included. However, Shruti offered a Club Package that included breakfast and Club Lounge access. I did take up this offer. We were also given a room with balcony that was part of the garden so that the kids could play.  Then to my surprise, Shruti took us herself to our room and ensured we had everything to make our stay a pleasant one. Room. Excellent room. Clean, lots of sundries, large, modern and well maintained. Bathroom was modern with walk-in shower and separate bath tub.  Large bed, fridge, large flatscreen TV, lots of closet space, iron, hairdryer etc.  Garden‚Ä¶"
3508,The Nomad from nowhere,5,Outstanding,"When I first arrived, I was quite distressed as I was told their was a transfer bus from the airport to the hotel. On arrival to the hotel we checked in with Deepika Sharma, she was really helpful and managed to get all our rooms on the same floor and provided outstanding customer service from the point of checking in and checking out. Deepika is an asset to the Grand Hyatt and would definitely return again on future visits."

The hotel nice and very comfortable the staff was excellent very helpful. The food in FIFTY FIVE EAST was excellent and outstanding. Special thank to Promod Sharma and Priyanka and I always looked forward seeing them when I was at the restaurant. In my personnel opinion the treatment you receive from the staff makes a big difference.  Also, the GYM was great. I am really looking forward coming back to sometime in the future. Overall it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed. Hyatt family should be very proud. Concierge, staff at the GYM, Security, front desk and the rest was all good no complaint.  The staff at the Mumbai Grand Hyatt treated me very good regardless of the membership I carried."
3510,Susila R,5,Excellent Stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"this was my 2nd stay at Grand Hyatt Mumbai. i decided to return here and had very good experience during my initial stay. Very good customer service, good food and comfortable stay. Hard to get at alot of hotels in India."

The staff in every department are warm & friendly & their  service is excellent."

We have booked a weekend offer and specifically mentioned that a couple of times over the telephone only to realize on check out that they decided to book us on another package. The weekend offer also included the use of the executive club floor. however on check in that was not the case.   As first time guests of this hotel, we were not shown around the hotel nor were we informed about the facilities they offered for guests staying in house. On several inquires about the club lounge, we were informed where to go however no additional information was provided. In addition, we were celebrating a birthday in our group and i went to inquire at the reception as to what they can do to make‚Ä¶"

We got married on the 26th of December 2015 in a very private ceremony with just 12 people on the guest-list. So we were really happy that Grand Hyatt, Mumbai decided to host us for three days just a day after our wedding. We‚Äôve had some of our most memorable dining experiences at their restaurants, so this just made it extra special.  We were won over with all the attention and warm greetings we got from the Hyatt associates upon our arrival. From day one we were made‚Ä¶"
3518,Hrishi0813,5,Excellent Service,"Location better, check in smooth and quick, help full staff and maintenance of the hotel awesome. Different variety of foods available and prices are also reasonable. I came for business trips and the business meeting arrangement at hall was also good."
3519,Biplav S,5,Nice hotel,"It is a very nice hotel with excellent services. The breakfast is in particular very good and restaurants are amazing too. The standard room is a bit small if you are traveling with kids. The construction I used to find earlier has been completed. Hence, it was nice to see the green courtyard and swimming areas. Overall, a satisfying stay."
3520,VacayJones,2,Mosquito Heaven,"I'm not sure if Hyatt has just decided to neglect all of its ""Grand"" hotels, but I've stayed at three in the last six months and each of them seemed to have been needing a substantial upgrade. I stayed here for 3 nights in February of 2016 and I don't know if it was the season or if just the hotels incompetence, but the whole place was infested with mosquitos and lighting fire outside of the lobby and having hotel staff walk around with mosquito zappers (even in the restaurants) didn't seem to help. We had to cut short at least two meetings because we couldn't take being bitten--and this was in the lobby cafe.   It was terrible and while I only get to Mumbai once a year, this will be the last time I'll be staying here."
3521,Ross A,5,Survey of Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"Overall everything was first class and excellent. The staff were friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and professional. Right from check-in to check-out everything was taken care off. The room was excellent and the club lounge was well staffed and catered."
3522,Faulkner8251,1,In need of Extermination and cleaning,I really believe that this hotel needs a through cleaning and extermination. There are insects everywhere and I was bitten so much that I had to see a doctor.  My room floor was dirty tables had not been properly cleaned. Both management and Hyatt Corporate should take this very seriously. Food is ok and the airport transfer costs are not market and way too expensive.
3523,narendra1964,5,REALLY A GRAND EXPERIENCE,The check in was very smooth. The room thought a little far away from the lobby was exceptional. The breakfast is a grand fare. The room service menu is very over priced. On one incident there was too much delay in room service and I complained also.
3524,mars27,5,Grand hotel with cozy service,"I stayed here 8 nights on business and found despite being a large hotel, the service is personal and friendly. Rooms are a good size (I had a king standard) with the usual standard amenities, as well as some extras such as bath salts, luxury soaps, bathrobe, slippers etc. The weekend I arrived there was a conference on and despite there being 350 odd delegates there is plenty of space in the hotel to cater for them without disturbing other guests. The only feedback is the housekeeping standard was not quite as good as during the week. This is understandable considering how busy they were.  I ate at both Cellini and China House, both of which I would highly recommend as the food is of high standard. What I liked was both restaurants have open kitchens and as a single diner this‚Ä¶"

3531,Redoranges,4,Typical Grand Hyatt that Gets 4 instead of 5 Ratings,"I could have given a 5, instead of 4 due to breakfast service and experience.   The spread was good, the ambience, the layout was perfect at the restaurant. However, staff wasn't very attentive. I was trying to get coffee and could not see any staff near but in a distance, there were like at least 4 staff standing in one corner. Although they may be talking about work, but I just feel that perhaps they could just still look around and be more attentive while talking to each other.  Also, as I was about to finish my first serving, I found a sticker label, but i am really not sure does it come from a fruit, a can food etc. I did want to inform one of the staff but they seems so busy and does walk past guests fast without looking. My intention was just to feedback but not complain,‚Ä¶"

3538,Saurabh T,2,Not so grand in service quality...,"While the name Grand Hyatt sets our expectation a truly impressive and professional hospitality, our experience during a conference of 500 plus guests was not so Grand. Though the team tried their best in managing the show but they had probably tried to bite more than they could actually chew. Check inn process and breakfast services showed their lack of planning and deployment of lesser number of people to handle a big conference. For many of us it was a first time stay at any Hyatt property and long waiting at check inn and restaurant mellowed our excitement.  I am sure team Hyatt would have provided us with best rates to organise a business meet, but that came at the cost of inefficient service."
3539,Ravi Pradeep P,4,The Hyatt level maintained,"One of the better Hyatt hotels I've been to. The rooms are great and so is the room service. Great restaurants is an added benefit as well.  The only downside I face is the staff at the reception were not ready to give me an extra room key, even when I showed my ID."
3540,Marsha123,5,Stunning hotel near to the airport,"This hotel is full of beautiful artwork, wonderful restaurants, lovely lovely staff, a perfect swimming pool and close to the airport.  Much better than many of the other five star hotels in mumbai, really worth a visit.  Especially of worth is their club lounge package which they serve 6 - 8 each evening.  A really delicious array of tasty sophisticated foods."
3541,Andrew S,5,Excellent Modern Hotel,The Grand Hyatt is an excellent hotel in a convenient location close to the airport.  The hotel is in very good condition and they maintain the property well.  There is an excellent selection of restaurants and the breakfast buffet is outstanding.  The internet service is good and there is no limit to the number of devices you can connect on your room account.  The rooms are quiet and comfortable; the staff is very courteous and helpful.
3542,TarunNPV,4,Efficiency and Warmth,"The Grand Hyatt is tucked a bit away from the international and domestic airports in Mumbai. But if you have work in the Bandra Kurla area, this is the place for you.  Efficiency hits you from the time the security scans your luggage to how the check in is done.  The murals, paintings and sculpture at the grand entrance really gets to you in a positive way.  One thing that this property gets in multiple tranches is conferences and weddings. The ball rooms are huge and service is efficient.  The rooms themselves give a touch of modern class and sensibilities , lifted up by technology.  Some of the rooms tend to have inconsistent bed sizes for some reason. But the room size itself is grand for a Mumbai hotel.  All in all a great choice for a comfortable stay , if you are ok to‚Ä¶"

At times the hotel getting so quiet an ironical setting from at least 500 meters afar where the noise & rush of speedily vehicles in metro Mumbai is too risky if you are not use with it.   The paintings and the arts in the hotel's lobby are treasures to behold, except the legion of staff at the reception & the concierge, they need to be given further training with customer service beyond reproach.   I stayed in one of the club rooms, so I have an access at the Lounge--food selections are poor--however, the lounge has an excellent view of the water falls!

Rooms are very comfortable, enormous and have necessary amenities.  Gym, sauna, restaurants and pub were great. Breakfast in the hotel was a great choice.  Location was great as it's near to Airport, beach and some other attractions.  I had a really very pleasant stay and would come back here again the next visit."
3549,Marc E,5,Amazing stay,"Grand Hyatt in Mumbai is the place to be for business trips in Mumbai. The facilities and restaurant are really five star and the staff are extremely friendly. Furthermore, the hotel is a few minutes from the Mumbai sea link which means you can benefit from both the quietness of the suburbs and the proximinity to the heart of mumbai. Also it is very close to the airport."
3550,Mandrake30,5,Excellent hotel,I always stay here when travelling via Mumbai. The location is excellent for the airport. If I had business in town I would stay elsewhere given its location. Very good service and delicious food. Rooms are comfortable and quiet. Nice bathrooms. Recommended.
3551,Surinda G,3,Good,Good customer service however on any rate changes very bad. I was booked at a higher rate however for the conference discount rate was available but the management never offered it after I checked in. No flexibility at all.
3552,RamShubsTar,4,"Top hotel, but beware the wedding groups!","Grand Hyatt is a good deluxe option if wanting to stay in the Western suburbs, about equidistant from the airport and the business district of BKC.  Pros - Large size rooms; the interior facing rooms look into the courtyard and the hotel structure with rooms on all four sides looking in into the large courtyard/rectangle give an almost palace like feel unlike that seen in most Bombay ""city"" hotels; the service is top notch and all needs are promptly attended, including a room change - which brings me to the negatives. Cons - Rooms with balcony tend to have mosquitos. Ask for an extra repellant lamp if you see many; the telephone system is iffy, or at least was the case in my room;  Most importantly, be careful which wing you are on. The rooms approached by lifts to the left are‚Ä¶"

The sauna, steam room and the large indoor jacuzzi were well maintained. The outdoor swimming pool and jacuzzi was even better. Breakfast although delicious was a bit hectic. Orders for tea, omelette or toast were never delivered. A late check out meant we could enjoy the facilities even longer than anticipated. "

The bathroom has a shower and a separate large hip  tub. There is plenty of hot water and good pressure. The room includes high quality toiletries that include a louder and bath salts.

Overall good place one should prefer it only for business trils

Nothing was too much trouble , We were treated like royalty throughout our stay. The service was perfect , the food wonderful. If you need a stay near the airport its a really good place to stay.it wasnt the bst location for us , but the accomodation and facilities were brilliant, we loved it. I would stay again if i wished to be pampered."
3563,Ujas_Doshi,4,Excellent hotel and polite staff,Grand Hyatt is very well known for hospitality. It was indeed an amazing time here. The staff is very helpful and polite. The ball room in the basement is one of its kind and isawesome for any official event.

I mean you cant step out of the hotel and shop or maybe enjoy some local shopping or delicacies. Finding public transport is also difficult and an Uber takes a good 10 minutes at least to come. But once you are inside the hotel is like you dont want to step out. They have a huge lobby area and the check in process is simple and fast. Rooms are very well designed with a lot of space, good large bathrooms with top of the line amenities.

3565,Brian E M,3,Nice but noisy,"Hotel is nice with attached restaurants and surrounding grounds, but is very noisy.  This includes proximity to the airport and hearing planes take-off at times until 3am for international flights.  Also noise between rooms is generally constant at times from mid-night to 3am with guest coming in late from activities.  Unfortunately, not a great hotel for business travelers that need to get up early in the morning with a good night sleep.  Club level is ok, but limited in food and drink selection."
3566,Mehak S,5,Preferred name of the hotel suites accordingly,"centralised location in the sub urban area with close vicinity towards airports.   Rooms not only comfortable, spacious , decorated  but have also European influence.  All in all beverages, restaurants and butler services both in-house and in eatery inside hotel were courteous.

I had booked a Honeymoon package in Kings/Queens size room for a friend's wedding night with included decorating the Room and complimentary cake. Honeymoon package costed us more than the normal one,  and we were fine to pay the extra charge for the package as they promised us for decoration and cake.  I confirmed with them about the decoration 2 hours before check in and also during check-in and they said that it's been done. Also they didn't allow us to check the room, fir the reputation they have we believed them, but then came to know through the friend later that there were special arrangements done that we paid extra for and it was just the room, that's it!

The service is good, typical of those large hotels, but well above average. Concerning the location, Mumbai is a huge place. I like it because it's 20 mins to the international terminal, and located toward the centre. There is not much in the immediate vicinity. It's a bit of a fortress."

3581,naziemk2016,5,Grand Hyatt Mumbai,The entire stay was an absolute joy. Ideal location for business meeting. just 20 minutes from the airport. An hour from the city though. If you know India that hour can escalate to 90 minutes quite easily.
3582,Ian J,5,A hotel with everything,"The hotel has excellent facilities.  Staff were very helpful and efficient.  The restaurants are very good with a variety of cuisines and the public areas are airy and well set out. The hotel is also very convenient for Mumbai airport, another big plus mark."
3583,Makarand S,5,"Stay quality at Grand Hyatt, Mumbai","It was a refreshing experience. Well located in the heart of Mumbai. Good connectivity to all directions. Well appointed rooms, well trained staff. excellent menu - all in all, a very enjoyable experience during my stay"
3584,Manishka14,5,Amazing experience !,"Definitely the place to be in Mumbai . Perfect room, staff, spa, swimming pool ! The staff at the reception is really helpful ! Again thanks to them ! The room is just heaven and if you feel tired , just have a cocktail by the side of the swimming pool !  My stay was just perfect ! "
3585,Stephen K,4,Mumbai Business Trip,"The hotel is will presented, very spacious and comfortable. Good amenities like pool and Gym. The staff are very helpful and courteous, close to airport for travel.  Can be costly compared with some other hotels but the experience and atmosphere is worth the extra cost."
3586,NitKals,4,Superb Hotel,"We did a product launch at Grand Hyatt this week and I must say that the Hotel scored extremely well on all fronts. The check in for our group was smooth and fast, the Grand Rooms are spacious and tastefully done, the toiletries are top class, the breakfast at Celini and 55 degrees langitude were great, the grand ballroom is great and our event went on like clockwork, the entire team comprising of Shane, Kris, Atul, Manoj and Sumit and his F&B team were great, the food served was great so kudos to the Chef and his entire team, overall a great business hotel with   a great location, highly recommended."
3587,Abhishek S,5,Exactly what a business traveling hotel should be?,"The reason I am writing this review can be contextualized against my review for Crowne Plaza Electronic city Bengaluru. Grand Hyatt is everything that the Crowne Plaza was not. I stay at this place each year because of an annual NASSCOM event. The hotel is packed to the brim, restaurants are overflowing. Still, these guys dont miss a beat. Everything that you need (basic toiletries, printing necessities, people at the right places to guide you to conference rooms, etc.) is just where you need it. Almost as if they read you. I was pleasantly surprised. One very basic example - I had to print my boarding pass and I was given the concierge's email id. I thought I'll send it and then pick it up on my way out. Within minutes of my sending it in the email, the boarding pass was‚Ä¶"

3589,Kamal Kumar G,5,BUSINESS TRIP,"This is very good 5 star hotel located at the best of the Mumbai location. Hotel is neat and clean with courteous staff and always ready to help. Food is good but it‚Äôs relatively costlier than the food in other 5 start hotels, not sure why. Overall good experience and would love to come back again to this hotel"
3590,Jimmy B,3,One night stay for work,"A good hotel, but the service is a bit far from I could see in the other Hyatt: It looks very desorganized an the managing staff talks rudely to the poor employees. The food is quite good though, and offers a wide range of choice."
3591,sonny218,5,Last minute travel,"We were not sure of what hotel to book on our last minute travel.  But I am so happy we ended up at this hotel.  From check in to check out every staff member was so friendly, courteous and helpful.  I am very happy with this hotel and will definitely visit them again in my next trip. "
3592,Rashmi,4,Great ambience,It's a beautiful hotel with great ambience. Even the way lobbies and out her public places are done it's a pleasure for eyes. The only downside was mosquitoes as somehow the place had so many of them that sitting anywhere was difficult. But the ambience reminded me of T2 mumbai terminal. 
3593,Travelogy510,5,Great Hotel with with Great Food!,"The ambience of the hotel is great as expected from any hotel of this category. We went there for our anniversary celebration and chose to dine at their Chinese restaurant which was super amazing. The selection of dishes were great and the best part was that there were ample choices for vegetarians like us. As it was our anniversary, they also served a small cake after the dinner. overall it was great and I would say, one of the best places to have Chinese food."
3594,Khurelbaatar G,2,Poor customer service,"Let's start with check-in process. We have told the front desk that we did not need visa to enter India as we have the diplomatic passport, but they insisted on checking every page and still look for Indian visa. Took them good 5 minutes. Even though we had reserved the Presidential Suite, the room was not at all what they had describe to me. Called number of time and took them at least an hour to bring us an ashtray. We called the customer service to order breakfast, service was of course late and made so much noise when we were conducting a meeting with other delegates. Oooh, the blood sucking companion... mosquitoes... so many of them. the in room mosquito fragrance does NOT work.  so be prepare to share your blood with them."
3595,Viral P,5,The perfect stay,"I have been a regular at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai. And have always left as a content man. This time around also the Hotel dint fail to satisfy me. I believe all the brownie points goes to the staff, a special mention would go to Mr.Arslan Siddiqui at the club lounge. He received us with a very warm welcome, and struck exactly the right balance between offering us warm hospitality whilst maintaining an element of privacy for me and my wife. He was extremely helpful, professional and gracious He went out of his way to meet my wifes insistence of staying in a particular room, and all of this while managing his desk duties and helping other colleagues. My wife and me wanted to express our gratitude to him for this exceptional top notch service we received during our stay and making it‚Ä¶"
3596,sandeepmohangupta,5,One night stay for personal visit,"Hotel continues to be charming and offers the comfort. Since the last visit, hotel has maintained its service quotient, upkeep of the property and room comfort.  Beds are comfortable. Bathrooms are good and have good quality accessories. cleanliness is of highest order. Breakfast spread is dam good and huge.  Gym is well equipped and continues to be in excellent condition.   Air conditioning control is good and room does not become too cold in night.  overall a damn good property.."
3597,TravellerInfy,4,Luxurious room but bad service,"Awesome rooms, classic ambiance but equally bad house keeping and service. Toiletries were missing, Iron was not working, Food was not at all up to mark. But again this is with expectations set too high.. For an average hotel all was perfect, but one demands more when you are at Hyatt...."
3598,hjagtiani,5,It is Hyatt and it is Grand,"I've been staying at the Grand Hyatt in Mumbai for past 10 years and at least twice a year. Typically in February it is to attend a conference with more than 1,000 delegates and the hotel has accommodated and handled the rush quite well. I've enjoyed the service and particularly the Club Lounge facility."
3599,krishy06,1,Rubbish - don't bother staying here,Shocked by the lack of quality was a Hyatt hotel! We encountered the rudest most sexist front desk manager ever! He spoke down to me and after a long flight it was unappreciated! This hotel make promises they are unable to keep and then have no remorse or compassion! I would not recommend this place to anyone and would not stay at this dumb again! Although it looks nice appearances are deceiving and the staff spoil this hotel! For such a reputable hotel you would expect respectable staff who value customers! Also if you ask for a general manager you will be told that he isn't on site so not of much help! Lots of mosquitoes everywhere in the lobby as well! Just generally disappointing considering the high prices! Stay at the regency Hyatt by the airport it's way better! 
3600,Rajiv S,4,Experiance,The overall experiance very good.The TV channel pacage was not adequate.They shoud include the local channels and some popular hindi channels in TV The items kept in Refrigator should not be chargable
3601,Mayuresh D,5,My stay at Grand Hyatt,"I stayed for 3 nights at Grand Hyatt, Mumbai as part of the NASSCOM NILF conference. It was a very pleasant stay, the rooms were very clean and comfortable, food was very good but the gym was my piece of cherry :) Loved it!"

3603,JandenBraber,4,Great hotel in a great place,"We are staying in a club suite which gives us the benefit of using the club lounge, very useful when you are setting up a business. The facilities in hotel are good, as you might expect from a hotel at this level. The breakfast is great and elaborate. Staff are friendly and more than helpful. Location is central in Mumbai, close to airport."
3604,2travelersLondonUK,5,A Mumbai Oasis,"This is an ideally located quality hotel which represents great value for money. Our room was very comfortable, spacious and well appointed. the common areas and lounges throughout the hotel are of an equally high standard as is the level of service. The Pool and terrace area is very attractive and has very comfortable sun loungers and, again, a high quality of staff service. Overall we were very impressed both by the the standard and efficiency of this hotel.   The location is excellent for the airport"
3605,Manmohan S,5,Desitraveller,The Grand Hyatt's around the world never disappoint. Recommend all the Hyatt hotels in India they are all outstanding hotels with great F&B and ambiance. Very convenient location near Mumbai Airport..
3606,convie,3,mosquitoes Galore,"I have stayed here and reviewed before. Though the rooms are a bit run down, the service levels and quality of food is still excellent.  Staff are very helpful and always smiling.   To retain your standards you need to do something about the mosquitoes. While I understand that it may be beyond your control, mosquitoes in the restaurant, lobby and banquet halls are just not acceptable for a hotel like this. Remember we are paying big bucks not to be bitten!  And once again, the plates in 55 east. You will save  cost by just having proper size plates.  Does not look like anything is done after reading reviews. So no major expectations on this one either."

3610,mitchy1818,1,Slipping standards,This is a hotel I loved and been visiting over the years but the standards have been slipping over the year. The toiletries are sub standard and cheap for a hotel of this stature.  Was booked on the club floor for a Confernce and paying club floor prices and today their coffee machine at the lounge was not working.   Not acceptable at all.

3614,YPALOBA,4,Good Stay ! Great Hotel,"We spent 3 nights and 4 days here, our stay was lovely. The rooms were in immaculate condition. Everything was working fine and the service was very prompt. Although we had the concierge desk was right outside our room on the first floor. which was not very comfortable..  none the less. It was pleasant."
3615,Guillermo B,5,Grand Hyatt Mumbai,Great hotel and excellent service. The staff went above and beyond to make my stay special. Centrally located and convenient for conducting business as well as receptions.  I would highly recommend for anyone traveling to Mumbai.
3616,gagan g,1,Very dangerous mosquitos,"I have been having a very bad experience, there are very big dangerous mosquitos in the restaurant which scared me . How can there be mosquitos in a 5 star hotel like this . This is not my first visit in that restaurant, I killed some mosquitos while having dinner with my wife , then I complained the staff about it, they sent a housekeeper with a mosquitos bat , but still didn't help, please be aware of the dangerous disease spreading mosquitos which should never be In a 5 star hotel after paying such a big amount of money to be there"
3617,RobCreview,5,Highly recommended for comfort & business,"This is a great place to stay and just about perfect for comfort.  When I showed a very old Hyatt gold card, they threw in a free breakfast.  You could of course be anywhere in the world but at that point this was fine.    The one downside is that the food is not cheap by Indian prices.  One evening i made the mistake of wandering off to find a grocery shop for a light supper and beer take-away.  Such things did not exist around there.  it was an interesting experience and eventually I found a great bakery and a fruit stall, but alcohol is not sold on Independence Day.   Rather than use a more expensive hotel car, the concierge set me up with a 'Cool Cab' enabling me to see Mumbai with my driver as a guide for a very reasonable cost."
3618,Altaf R,4,lovely and comfy rooms with an outdoor space,"love this place , the rooms are the best the hotel has to offer in Mumbai , good finish well designed a bit small but that can be overshadowed with the open area it compliments , the outdoor sitout should have been provided with some garden furniture that would add wonders to the beautiful ambiance ... food was lovely specially the Sunday brunch .."

3621,Vishal T,4,Awesome but expensive,"As I have mentioned in title, it is true, Grand Hyatt is awesome but definitely an expensive option but if you are ready to pay for luxury then Grand Hyatt is among the few option in the city. I like there food specially the breakfast menu but they need to increase the space for sitting arrangement for Breakfast buffet. Definitely it is a beautiful property   "
3622,marie083,2,So noisy,"Whilst all the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, it does not make up for the noise and other discomforts I experienced whilst staying here. Firstly, I asked for a quiet, non-smoking room, away from the lifts. I got a smoking room, next to the lift, in which the smell of smoke lingered for the whole stay. Despite non-smoking signs in the hallway, that area stank of smoke.  I was woken up early with loud voices and banging from above and to the side (guests and cleaning staff judging from the sounds). It sounded as if everyone was in my room, and went on for an hour, after which I gave up and got up, terrible sound proofing. This was all on top of having been disturbed both nights by the incredibly loud music of the parties going on downstairs. The base sound is so loud you‚Ä¶"
3623,AsifKhan_Delhi,5,"Nice hotel, excellent service and other facilities","The hotel is quite close to airport and close to highway therefore you can easily access airports (both) without worrying about traffic. The rooms are spacious and good quality, the breakfast is excellent with many varieties."
3624,suresh rajani,4,excekkent,"I went for lunch and I ordered a biryani. When it first came to me it was really bland. I talked to the chef and he made me another biryani. Apparently if you are a foreigner they make a bland dish as some of the spices are too spicy. Anyways, the replaced dish was amazing."
3625,Christopher H,5,Best Hotel in Mumbai,"If you are looking for a great service, excellent restaurants and amazing facilities you should stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai. The hotel is situated in prime location with an easy access to the airport and expressway."

All sumptuous tasty :) Really liked the presentation of cakes and bakery items..."
3627,Mike_in_Dubai,4,Good but staff need better training,"My room and the basics of my stay were very good but i was dissatisfied with my restaurant experiences.   The food was excellent but the service was very poor.     Our first night we ate at the Indian restaurant and ordered a bottle of wine from the menu.  Half way through the main course and after appetizers we were told the bottle we ordered was not available.   The alternate bottle we ordered was brought at the end of our meal bit the waiter couldn't open it and broke the cork in his attempt.   Some minutes later the waiter returned having managed to decant the cork imbued wine into a carafe.   We tried the Italian restaurant the following night.  Once again, late in the meal out wine still hadn't arrived.   We called the waiter and we were only then informed the wine we‚Ä¶"

3629,Roshik,5,Fantastic - true 5 star experience,"Stayed in an executive club room with friends, while the room size was slightly smaller than expected the service and amenities made up for it! The food, gardens. club in the hotel was great and is in good proximity to the airport!"
3630,Traveller C,4,Good weekend stay,"We went here for 2 nights stay. We stayed in the Verandah Suite. It was really great experience. The suite was spacious. It had separate living room & bedroom. The in room dining service was really good. We had a great relaxing weekend. The only thing that could have been better was the service at the breakfast buffet. We had to ask multiple times just for 2 glasses of water. And it wasn't like there were many guests to attend to which could have caused delays in the service. However, except that, overall it was a good experience"
3631,Neeraj_Taneja,5,Satisfactory experience ...,"Been There for 2 nights to attend a seminar in mumbai in Dec 2015. It was a good experience , great breakfast , great food. Rooms were nicely done, got a swimming pool view room.  Very strict security checks at the entrance.. Overall the experience was satisfactory."
3632,Andreas R,2,Loud and inattentive managment,"I do not mind that parties take place at a hotel, but if that party has extreme loud music until past midnight with a bass that shakes the building and makes it difficult to eat at a restaurant or sleep in a room, then at least I expect information from management in advance and the option to move to a quieter room. None of that happened, not even when I complained.  Answer given: next time you come we will get you a quiet room.  That is not Grand Hyatt class !  Certainly there won't be a next time for me."
3633,Ritesh P,5,Wonderful Hotel with great staff,I would definitely recommend that anyone and everyone stay at the Grand Hyatt in Mumbai. All of the hotel staff is very helpful and welcoming. The room was kept very neat and tidy during my stay and the hotel has a large number of food options.

3636,AjitVellore,5,Opulence Redefined,"Considering the fact that space is at a premium in Mumbai, this is one expansive place. Was informed that this is close to the airport. However the transfer took at least 45 mins in the rush hour traffic.Suddenly off the Expressway the sloping road takes you to a lofty edifice called the Hyatt. The terraced lobby gives an impression of an grand structure.  The staff are polite and unobtrusive. Rooms are excellent. The Bar is well accessible on the lobby level and so is the lounge. The warmth of the restaurant called Fity five East lives up to its name!"
3637,Shruti Gera,4,Just the right place for your stay,"Grand Hyatt Mumbai is located very close to the airport and is also very close to Bandra which I consider the 'Goa' of Mumbai. Apart from the advantage of location, it has a popular night club called ' China House' and an even nicer restaurant with the same name offering the best possible oriental cuisine.  The gym here is quite nice too and so is the Italian restaurant here .  It's got a nice mall in its premises with a nice coffeeshop and an interesting bookstore too . Liked my stay here and will surely go again"
3638,JeffnLiz V,5,A true luxury hotel,Wonderful service by the staff across the board.   The rooms are very comfortable with plenty of space.  The breakfast buffet is expansive and more than enough for anyone.  Convenient from the airport but not much to do in the immediate area outside the hotel.  
3639,Jerry D,4,Pleasant stay,Had a three night stay this past weekend for business meetings in the hotel. Nice rooms very nice sttaff.  All the meals were in the hotel and the food was excellent. If I may add a comment on the meeting room doors and walls.They need a good cleaning. You can see from different angles and the way the sun shine it has different streaks and smudges on it. The proximity to the airport was a big plus. Look forward to the next visit. Hope we will have out Annual Indian meeting there next year.

3642,Globetrotter_NA,4,Nice luxury hotel!,"Stayed at this property on business purpose. The location is good as it's close to the international airport but there is nothing really just outside the hotel. The rooms, I felt, were good but pretty basic for a 5-star hotel. That said, the rooms are comfortable and have all necessary complimentaries. Didn't really get the time to use the pool.  Staff is courteous and friendly. They allowed me to check out a little late since I got really late due to meetings and traffic and I appreciate the gesture. Dined at 55 east and found the buffet to be good. Room service and breakfast were also decent.   Overall a good option if you would like to stay in this part of Mumbai."
3643,DoubleTrouble86,4,"Nice luxurious hotel, dining could be better","Nice Luxurious hotel. Clean and big rooms, Nice office tables to work. Experience with front office staff was not so great though. I thought I had been upgraded to club member with access to club lounge, but turns out I wasn't. Had to find it from a staff at club lounge. With the price that you pay for this kind of restaurant you'd expect excellent quality of dining but unfortunately that was not the case. Food was below average."
3644,Antony C,4,Nice stay but not so nice front office!,"The behavior of the front office staff was arrogant. We were group check in for a conference but their attitude pissed me off. Rest of the room service, decor, comfort were all nice. The breakfast was stunning. The other foods over the next 2 days were also good. House keeping was superb. Big wash area in the room. User friendly bathroom fittings but hand faucet in the loo."

We had a lovely welcome and a great room with robes and excellent bed.  The hotel was lovely to walk around as it has many stunning art installations. We ate in Soma which served very tasty though rich food but it was expensive. Overall a very comfortable stay with helpful staff. It is quite a long way from downtown Mumbai but we would stay there again!

I think they are living in the early man pre historic era when phone calls were a luxury.  There is no rationale and 5 star hotels are used to their own way of things.. No restriction on this in any form.   Just charge guests anything as they are fools. Right? need refund immediately."

3651,Barry B,1,Rubbish Hotel,"The bad experience began at Check in, we were told room will be ready in 1 hour even though we checked in at 7. However, we received the keys to the room at 11 PM. We had requested adjoining rooms, and so were left waiting for ages before we got the second room. Every time we complained we were told the room would be ready soon. It was not. Even when we did get our room we found it to be in a filthy state. The drain in the shower was clogged up with hair and other plastic objects, and chip packets and crumbs everywhere. My bedsheets even had stains. We requested a rollaway bed which also took a long time to come, and the staff member who brought it had only one small paper thin mattress for it, this was unacceptable to me and when I complained I was told to take it or leave it.‚Ä¶"

Very welcoming staff, and excellent room which was modern, spacious and comfortable. Breakfast is taken in the restaurant on the ground floor near to the reception area, and it was a real treat. I asked the waiter for some advice on what local dishes to try and ended up being talked through a few different dishes which were brought to me to try out, all of the tasting amazing. I really liked the local masala tea, and filled my suitcase with some from the mall. There is a mall attached to the hotel which is well worth a look, and better prices than the airport for presents.

3653,Neil R,5,It's grand indeed,"Wow-this is how you run a hotel.The Grand Hyatt is the most amazing hotel I've seen and I've seen a lot of them in my life. From the pool to the spa everything is just to breathtaking in this amazing hotel,and the staff were super friendly and always willing to help any of the guest with anything necessary.   RE: Do make sure you visit one of their traditional restaurants for a good meal."
3654,Bryce T,3,Nice Stay,"Nice hotel... Rooms were very clean and well serviced... Starting to date... Staff were pleasant and very happy... Food was great and enjoyed the lamb chops, they were fantastic! In comparison to other hotels, drinks were very expensive and over the top in the bar... Overall it was ok... "
3655,Eugene D,5,"Great stay, superb service","The service at this hotel is superb. We arrived at 5 am and by 9 were in our rooms, although check in was at 2 pm. The staff were helpful, and ever ready to help. The hotel itself was great, a wonderful escape from chaotic Mumbai. Great gym, pool, spa and sauna. Will return! PS The breakfast was awesome!"
3656,Jagruti K,4,Holiday,"We really enjoyed staying at the Grand Hyatt with family , everything is"" Grand "" about this hotel , their rooms are very spacious , we had no complains except for their room service gets a bit slow , I simply loved their Masala chai which was served during breakfast ....the restaurant fiftyfive east has excellent food too, the chefs make very good Thai and vegetarian sushi that I tasted there , the staff were friendly and helpful during our stay , I simply liked the security as well , they checked and eyed each and everyone entering and exiting the hotel .....kudos to the hard working team ....and thank-you so much for a great hospitality ....I definitely wish to come back :)"
3657,Faraad,5,A Brilliant Hotel,Stayed here in December 2015. Very pleasant stay at a brilliant hotel. Rooms are very comfortble and spacious The only draw back is that the staff are not as freindly and welcoming as other hotels i have recenltly stayed at. Could do with a little personnel touch.
3658,David J,5,Second Time is Just As Good,"Just as good as the first time. This time I took advantage of the gym, which is fully equipped with cardio machines, nautilus and free weights. I also took advantage (again!) of the great restaurants at the Grand Hyatt. I highly recommend 55 East and the China House. Another excellent business trip. Thank you!"
3659,Jasmeen G D,5,Princess Pampering at Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"While I've been a regular diner at Grand Hyatt and partied at the star-truffled China House Lounge, I've never stayed there. Myriad rooms, Residences with its private driveway, staggering categories of suites, and a mall. Add fine dining restaurants, gourmet store, nightclub, spa, gym, pool ‚Äî it's the perfect staycation! So when the opportunity presented itself, I made reservations, and arrived at noon. Boasting of a sleek minimalist decor, the hotel's splendor enveloped me as I walked a flight up to check-in and was escorted to a suite. High ceiling and cityscapes, plush bedroom adjacent to a large bathroom with a shower, toilet and tub with sea salt. For business, there's a workstation in the living area adjacent to a sofa set with chocolates, fruits and wine. I had hardly‚Ä¶"
3660,Nusi J,5,A fantastic hotel,Stayed at the grand hyatt for 4 nights and really enjoyed our stay at this family friendly hotel...Felt soooo comfortable and recieved a very warm welcome at check in from a young gentlemen named Karan...Jus that the location of hotel is a little too far tucked away from the hustle n bustle n restaurants of Mumbai...would recommend for a family stay. 
3661,Melbourne-Aust,4,A little underwhelmed,By reading others reviews I just must have got a little unlucky. Nothing major to stop me from staying again but small maintenance details in the room that I would have expected better from a Grand Hyatt.
3662,Rak92,5,Fantastic Service.. Rooms were like living in the lap of luxury!,Me and my family were treated in the best possible way at Grand Hyatt.. Every need was taken care of. Fantastic place to stay. Service was excellent!  I would certainly CERTAINLY come here again. Loved it!
3663,soorakarthik,5,One of the best in Mimbai!!!,"This being one of the best 5 star hotel's does not require any introduction or a review for that matter. Located in a pretty good area in Mumbai, it is close to Airport, Juhu beach and some of the most visited places in Mumbai. The hotel looks really amazing and have got an awesome reception area. Their check-in process is pretty simple and took minimal time. The only thing that bothered me was, we had to carry our luggage on our own which was pretty new for me in a 5-star. The room itself was really good, has all the required amenities you would see in a star hotel. Along with the regular amenities, there was provision for a projector and a nice business desk in the room. There was a nice big window with an awesome view of Mumbai along with a mesmerizing view of the sunset‚Ä¶"
3664,AK_,5,Perfect,"This hotel gets everything right, from the service to the quality and size of rooms to the restaurants within the hotel. The hotel is well located since it is accessible to the airports but also at reasonable distance to the relevant business areas and social hotspots within the city. A definite step-up and far improved version over its counterpart Hyatt Regency near the airport."
3665,Balakrishna A,4,Comfortable business hotel,I've been a regular visitor to this hotel for nearly 11 years and i enjoy going back. Staff is very friendly without being overbearing. Location being just off highway near the airport makes it a convenient place. Multiple restaurants caters to differing taste buds. However the buffet breakfast wasn't good and disappointed with it
3666,BobbyPtravels,5,Amazing start to India trip,"This hotel is close to the airport, which makes it a great location if you are traveling within India shortly after arriving to Mumbai like we did. due to security reasons one has to go through metal detectors at any nice hotel and this one is no exception. The lobby is grand and there are several restaurants located in it. the check in process was very quick and pleasant. the staff were very friendly. We had a club level room which was very nice and gave us access to the club which served food and drinks through out the day. WiFi was included in the room and so was breakfast although we ate most of our breakfast at the club. We also dined at three of the restaurants during our stay and food was great. I particularly enjoyed the Indian traditional breakfasts. We had a false‚Ä¶"

3670,Ankush J,5,Excellent Hotel,The stay here was the best I had in India. Room service was bit slow but that's just isolated mainly because of some event at Hotel may be. Must stay again ! They should offer complimentary pickups from Domestic and international airports. Xx
3671,Michele M,5,Wonderful hotel near the airport,"We stayed here for two days while traveling. The rooms are wonderful, spacious, and incredibly comfortable. The service--front desk, concierge, room service--were all fantastic and friendly. You're a 15-minute drive to the airport as well as to Bandra, a great neighborhood to explore.   You are a bit further away from South Mumbai where many of the other tourist attractions are. So this may not be everyone's ideal hotel, but it was great for us."

The hotel itself is very clean and the rooms are quiet. The breakfast is exceptional with so much choice - all food fresh and so tasty.

I've stayed in numerous hotels in Mumbai including the four seasons, Jwm and the leela, the service provided here is second to none.  I'm travelling with my wife and 2 children, we had booked a club room, upon arrival at the airport we were met by the driver, we explained outaughter was feeling unwell and he drove us to the nearest doctors clinic waited for us to be seen then drove us to the hotel. Well above and beyond the call of duty. Upon check in we were able to relax and have a drink whilst the paperwork was pressed in the club lounge.

The hotel is excellent with respect to service, food, rooms, cleanliness, everything. the rooms are spacious and well equipped. the staff is very prompt as well. in short a very good hotel and its wirth all the money you spend for it. if you are looking for a hotel in this area, this hotel will fulfill all your expectations."
3678,Bkap11,5,Fantastic Hotel,"We checked in early morning at 6am and the staff were of great help. The property is well kept and the service is of the highest quality. Rooms are spacious and comfort levels are quite high. I had breakfast and lunch at the hotel on 2 occasions and the food is excellent although pricey, but you expect that from a 5* hotel in India. The hotel is relatively quiet at night time which is nice when you want to sleep. I would highly recommend this hotel as it's only 20 mins away from the airport. I would stay at this hotel again as it's probably one of the better 5* hotels in Mumbai."
3679,anant254,5,One of the Best hotels in Mumbai,"Stayed here for a weekend. The hotel is large and luxurious. Rooms are mid sized and impeccable. The breakfast spread is large, varied and good ranging from cold cuts to South Indian items. The swimming pool is small and becomes cramped if there are a large number of residents. Hotel has a steam rooms and sauna as well which are separate for men and women. Overall a charming hotel to stay in."
3680,Prof_Von_Nostrand,3,Fantastic property ruined by below average service,"We stayed here for three nights (including the new year's).   The hotel is 15 minutes from the airport (in regular traffic) and fairly close to BKC and most places in Bandra. The property itself is magnificient - rooms are spacious and well appointed and their free wifi is fast and stable.  The check-in process (including the gate staff) went very smoothly for us, but the problems with their service started right from that moment. Here's a few examples: 1. Tea bags were not replaced   2. Cups and glasses were not replaced (we had a friend staying in an adjacent room and had kept our glasses there - a fact that the hotel staff was informed about)  3. Used knives were not replaced  4. They closed one set of elevators on 31st evening without any notice to hotel guests. On receiving‚Ä¶"
3681,Daniel,5,Excellent hotel close to the airport,"Stayed here with my wife for 4 nights just after New Years. Hotel is outstanding! Gym facilities are some of the best I've seen, including the pool area, spa, sauna and steam room. Buffet breakfast is outstanding and includes a variety of Indian and western cuisines. Service is outstanding, as one would expect for a 5 star hotel in India. Our room was spacious, as was the bathroom. Bottled water is provided for free on a daily basis and by request. Only criticism is the hard bed, but was 'soft' for Indian standards. Overall, a pleasant experience. We have a night booked here on our way back home...very happy with that decision!"
3682,Charvinia N,3,Nothing but a pretty face,"We stayed here on a family vacation in December 2015. The Grand Hyatt has an impressive lobby, stunning rooms and is an all round beautiful hotel. It's a shame that living there was awful.  The staff in the hotel are particularly rude and unhelpful (particular emphasis on the front desk). You take for-granted how dependant you are on hotel staff until you are in a country in which English isn't the primary language, and trying to get advice/help from anyone in the hotel felt like an absolute nightmare.  Apart from the attitude of the staff, the service in general was pathetic - at breakfast it's clear that they are understaffed with us waiting for 20-45 minutes for coffee during our 5 night stay; we waited 50 minutes for a bath towel one evening; asking for a manager to escalate‚Ä¶"
3683,ramnik321,4,problems at the hotel,It was an excellent hotel but very bad service. 2 of the young girls in our party has hotel service guys enter thier rooms at 5am with master key when the girls were sleeping. They were instructed to clean the room as if it was free.  Furtehr this happened again when it was occupied by just on of the girls.  The cleaners and the managment booking had not been co-ordinated. The girls were scarred. We would NEVER use this hotel again. I would warm anyone booking this hotel to be careful.  Ramnik Shah
3684,Shwets_78,4,awesome food,the food at grand hyatt is yimmy be it the breakfast buffet in their coffee shop or in room dining. you must definetly try the chicken tikka sandwich and the apple crumble pie at the coffee shop its yummilious!
3685,AdvaitKurlekar,4,Luxurious,"This is a fantastic hotel to stay with very good utilisation of space. The lobby lounge, an odd nook or corner has not gone unattended. I got a room without a view (they informed about it in advance) as there was some construction work going on, but it really didnt matter. Got a suite because of that!"
3686,20kash,1,Never again,"India is notorious for its hospitality but that sure wasn't the case here. The end of the year brings crowds and parties all fun to witness. Understandably, service is slower but 4 hours. Also, we required a room with an extra bed. They apparently never got the message despite the 30 min conversation and emails. They were nice enough to provide one free room overnight. Then shifted everything into the other room. The bed caused bruises on all the room members with the metal sticking out. Complaints were not responded to. Never never again. India is beautiful but this hotel is horrible. So so much better out there!"
3687,Thekkemadom,5,Very Efficient Hotel,The Grand Hyatt is a conveniently located and efficiently run hotel near Mumbai Airport. We stayed at this hotel just for one night but were impressed.  The transportation from and to the airport was arranged by the Hotel and it was very efficient. The room was clean and comfortable and the hotel facilities that we used were all of high standard.  We particularly enjoyed the Dinner at the Hotel‚Äôs Italian restaurant.  This will be our hotel of choice every time we have to stay close to the airport in Mumbai.

They provide half a kg cake if one has the honeymoon package. The hotel is located pretty close to the western express highway. So the location wise its quite good. We just had one day of stay here, but it was a pleasant stay, meeting all the expectations that one has from a luxurious 5 star hotel."

The way the hotel staff dealt with this was very professional and turned what could have been a huge negative into an overall positive stay. Sometime things happen and this is understandable but the way they are dealt with is really what can have an impact. The staff of Grand Hyatt Mumbai displayed this and I say special thanks to Manali Bhat for all her help.   I was upgraded to a club room and then later to one of the apartments. Everything I needed was provided. As an apology for the incident I also received complimentary wine and sweets to the room. Not necessary but appreciate the thought.

3691,DasTraveller,4,Wow Grand Hyatt,This hotel was booked by my office due to its proximity to my place of work. I stayed here for 2 nights and it was a really great experience. Everything from check in to check out  was very smooth. The buffet breakfast was mind-blowing and so was the dinner buffet.
3692,Cheryl_Bill,4,Service was top notch and safe hotel,"Chose hotel for security.   Traveling by self and wanted to ensure safety.   Hotel staff were extremely accommodating and helpful.   I was first put in a room on floor 1 which had a sliding glass door to patio overlooking public courtyard.   I asked to be moved to a higher level as I did not feel as safe.   This request was at 11pm at night and the staff immediately found a room with same features on an upper floor.   The restaurant breakfast had a wide variety of options, very good.   Room was comfortable for working.   Only complaint is speaker phone not a high quality - conference calls were not clear."
3693,Kanishka M,1,Bad Loyalty Program and Policies,"The hotel conveniently excluded over 30 nights from my stay from their loyalty program due to ""certain policies and rates"" . After several email exchanges with the hotel relationship manager Monica who took up my case with her management, I got some 38 nights restored out of the 60 odd nights I have actually stayed there. First the hotel refused to consider my stays through a third party. Later there was some ""conditions apply rate"" and refused to consider by bookings as valid stays for points when I booked it on their website. Finally I got in touch with the customer services team to book through them and after completing my stay, I was told you had not stayed for the 5 nights minimum for us to consider 4 days.

3696,Dhruv A,5,restaurant,this 5 star has an excellent italian restaurant named celini which according to me serves the best italian food in bombay. it is expensive as it is a 5 star and a person can visit it atleast once a month. the service and presentation is fast and amazing. the pizza has a crisp thin crust with melted cheese over and perfectly baked. i am sure that all pizza lovers will like surely go and check for yourself.
3697,NalinTiwari,4,A little short of Grand,"Well it is everything you expect from a luxurious hotel but don't look too closely. Room was big, spacious and comfortable but has paper thin walls. one can effortlessly hear everything going on in adjacent room or corridor. Had dinner at their Soma restaurant which is their Indian kitchen, food was priced a little on the higher side but delicious. Also, for the price they charge, little things should have been taken care of & there should be some consistency in their service towards all the tables."
3698,IMT,4,Good quality business hotel,"Stayed for 4 nights for business, standard chain 5* hotel, very easy for the airport.    Only gripes I have were as we were working UK hours noise from the corridor outside the room post 9am IST woke you up if you weren't a deep sleeper, and they would extend my colleague's check out by 1 hour but not mine.  China House restaurant food and venue was amazing, although service could've been better - we were working late and knew we would arrive near closing time so when we reserved a table we pre ordered roast duck (as this takes time).  When we arrived it wasn't ready and we waited a long time for food of any kind.  Make sure that when they take the duck away that you ask for the remains back, they roast it again with spices, garlic etc  The buffet was ok and includes beer and‚Ä¶"

Had a memorable stay at Grand Hyatt, Mumbai."
3700,Sandi L,5,Excellent hotel,"The Grand Hyatt Hotel in Mumbai is an oasis in India.  The decor is beautiful.  The food in the restaurants is excellent.  And the service is very good as well.    The location of the hotel is the only down side as there is not alot to do nearby and Mumbai traffic is time consuming to get anywhere.  But, when you have restaurants, shops, and a fully equiped room - you really don't have to go out unless you want to.    The shower was very different with no doors just a ridge to keep the water inside.  It took time to get used to but it was very clean as there was only one wall.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
3701,suruchimehta,5,The grand sense of hospitality,"I recently happened to visit Grand hyatt for my cousins wedding, And as expected everything about this place met the grand standards : from the location, the ambience to the food and specially the staff,all of them take extra efforts to meet every requirement of the guests, especially Mr.Arslan Siddiqui at the club lounge, was very welcoming and attentive and went above and beyond his capacity to sort everything out and had a warm friendly attitude and at the same time very professional. His service surely does elevate the club lounge to a new level, he is a sure asset to the hotel and I would recommend him for an appreciation."
3702,pkraggarwal,1,To say the service is terrible is an understatement !,"I have never bothered to write reviews...but Grand Hyatt frustrated me so much that even a no nonsense person like me is writing one! will give that to you Hyatt ! The hotel  has absolute zero regard for guest convenience and I fail to understand why such obvious things are being overlooked.   1. No lift from entrance to lobby. If you have luggage, will find difficult to lift it up the stairs...Have u seen this anywhere. Dont bother , Mr. HYATT is setting new standards in customer disservice  2. I was given room 6142, used lift to go up and lo there is no sign to locate 6142  !! for 5 mins I kept searching but Mr HYATT proved too intelligent for me..

The restaurants here has a wonderful spread of menu that caters to every taste bud that we van think of. The Bar in the Lobby Level stock top international and IMFL brands that can be the most happening place for the evening break. Defenitely would recommend for a weekend getaway / corporate meet etc. The also have a good place enough to conduct a national level conference. A very good convention center which is a good attraction for anyone who is planning a big corporate get-together.
3707,Stefano,4,The sense of hospitality,The hotel is situated at no more than 10 minutes far from the domestic terminal. I tried n. 2 restaurants: the Italian and Chinese ones. Both of them are at very high level of taste. In the Chinese you can have a romantic dinner outside with a fantastic atmosphere with candles. Inside there is also a club with music and cocktails.  Grand Hyatt hotel has also a mall inside and at the ground floor of the shopping centre there is the confectionery  with real fresh bread and cakes. Lovely. Don't miss the outside pool in front of the gym with Jacuzzi. Everything in Grand Hyatt is at the top level of service.
3708,node75,5,Cusp of convenience and comfort,"I have been staying regularly at the hotel for the last one year. The location may appear to be a bit offbeat but it is unmatched for a business traveller or a tourist who has a criss crossed itinerary in Mumbai. Not only the hotel is very near to the Airport, it is also not sitting on the Airport tarmac, which makes it a little quite and calm. Pick any area in Mumbai .. be it the new & chic Bandra Kurla, or Andheri (E), or Worli enroute to South Mumbai or Juhu Beach or Thane .. there is a quick route to all these place from the hotel.   The Italian outlet offers nice thin crust pizzas. The gym is big. Check-inns are always smooth and swift.   The hotel is not tall but grand. Big galleries so you end up walking quite a bit if your room is away from the lift. The only let down is‚Ä¶"
3709,KVG55,5,A really grand hotel in the old style.,"Spent 4 nights attending my company seminar. The service at the reception was ordinary. The experience after that first brush of plebian was very good. The breakfast buffet is better suited to western taste, fine with me. The Gammon ham on leg with eggs is rare to find in India and made the mornings seem brighter. Servers produced cappuccinos with a smile. The restaurant Cellini where I had  my last night dinner, serves authentic Italian fare. The chef who had just arrived from the city of Genoa was extremely generous with his portions. One main course can feed a small family. Took a dip in the clean and cool pool on the morning of departure to Pune. Late check out granted without a murmur.

Perfect for long & short stays","We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Residences (service apartments) for four months - if I had my way, I would probably have booked in for two years if not for the fact that our furniture shipment was gathering dust in a movers warehouse. The location of Grand Hyatt is a little underwhelming as it sits right in the middle of the Kalina-Vakola spread. A true-blue Bandraite may wrinkle her nose at the thought of a five-star hotel in Vakola, but there are certain positives to its location - it is close to the commercial hub of Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), international schools like Ascend and ASB, relatively close to the buzzing Bandra suburb...

Hotel is located near the airport and offers excellent hospitality and service. The ambience in lobby area was luxurious and top class. We were given a upgrade on the room and totally loved it. The bathroom is amazing with spa style bath tub and rain shower. Staff are courteous and polite and ready to help even in the middle of the night. Will recommend it for transit through Mumbai or even for a longer stay.

I would like to specially mention about the breakfast. All the items in menu were delicious and yummy. Full marks to the Chef and supporting staff ! I will like to stay back again !"
3714,AyanBanP,4,Great hotel with unreasonably expensive food,"It was a nice stay at Grand Hyatt, Mumbai. Room was clean, nicely organised. Service was also very good. The only point which I could not appreciate is the expensive food. I understand that it is a 5 star hotel, but it looks like the food bill per day would be more than the room rent per day if you choose few items from their menu. Apart from this, I liked the hotel and the comfortable stay there."
3715,TeenaTT,5,Excellent hotel with 5-star service.,"The rooms, staff, choice of restaurants and bars, club lounge, cleanliness, airport transfer service, everything was smooth and excellent, with modern interiors.   Very conveniently located. They also have a shopping mall with some luxury brands.  Their restaurant, China House, is a top clubbing venue in Mumbai. And they have one of the best wide variety for breakfast I've been to.  The pool, gym and spa facility is amazing.  I would definitely go back again. "
3716,ashah_008,4,Great stay,"Stayed here when they had a ridiculously good value offer of ¬£50 for 2 nights (bed only). The hotel is impeccably clean. The rooms are decently sized and serviced well. The hotel has a number of restaurants including the buffet area, cafe, Italian, Indian and Chinese restaurants. Did not have time to check the pool and gym facilities.  It's location means that it's trickier to walk around to get anywhere and you do need to grab a tuktuk or auto."

Could hear my neighbour flushing qnd closing bathroom doors.   Breakfast is good and service is great but the property is not 5*.   There are better options in Mumbai. I will try not to return. 
3718,OrvarDraken,3,"Nice, but noisy","A well app pointed hotel near the Mumbai airport. However, as only 6 stories, and in India / Mumbai, and with a poor level of noise insulation, it means that all the street noises are right In many of the rooms (traffic, construction etc) - which room you get is kinda a gamble. Don't be afraid to make them move you. "

The property is located very close to both airports in Mumbai & Juhu beach is also nearby and that is indeed a great advantage. . Free complimentary wifi at good speeds are an added advantage. Pick up facility is provided, though is pretty costly. Overall a good experience indeed.  Thanks to Mfe for wonderful stay."
3720,111_Jimbo_uk,5,Exceptional Experience!,"We stayed here a few nights but we wish we could have stayed longer!  The Hotel is nicely set back off the road with airport level security for obvious reasons.  The first impressions of the establishment are amazing with fine sculptures and artwork everywhere you you look.  The staff are outstanding and have an impeccable level of training. We were greated by Rekha and she personally ensured our stay was excellent.  As it was our anniversary and they pulled out all the stops to celebrate the occasion. We recived a beautiful cake and bottle of fine wine. The assistant front office manager Gavin and his team are the benchmark of perfect service and politeness.  The facilities are immense with an impressive shopping centre, sports area, child care, banquet, Club lounge and‚Ä¶"
3721,A_Raj24,5,Great stay at the hotel,We stayed here for a night and the stay was perfect. Hotel has a huge and well maintained pool and gym. It has few of the best restaurants. Location is perfect if you want to roam about in city as well. 
3722,Paarin,5,Good Experience,"The approach to the location is a bit odd but once you step in it's a wonderful world within. nice restaurant, beautiful and very very comfortable rooms. The best part i like about the interiors is the tradition they carry all along the way."
3723,M-SINVAL,4,Think 5 star hotel and you get Hyatt,"Spent 4 nights in the hotel and it is everything you expect from an Hyatt: great service, nice food and very comfortable rooms. It is very nearby the airport which can be a disadvantage if you are using it as a logistic base to visit Mumbai. Rather than that, they make you fell like home. It is always a great choice. Ask for a room facing the swimming pool that will make your stay more comfortable."
3724,Padmaj K,3,High headed,"No lift from entrance to lobby. If you have luggage, will find difficult to lift it up the stairs. Nobody was around nor anyone bothered to help me carry my luggage.   Reception staff high headed.  I could see they were bothered only about certain skinned people. Will try to avoid staying when possible.   Room service was good.  "
3725,Sachinmohta,4,Decent place to stay,Decent business hotel for a comfortable stay and helpful staff. However be ware of making the payments through your card and not thru a travel agent or you will loose on your Hyatt Gold membership points. Painful for business travellers who get the billing thru travel agents and one might feel loyalty programme as an eye wash but yes this is the reality.
3726,Jenneffer P,5,Friendly and beautiful,"When visiting, do not forget the pool. The restaurants are nice with pleasant wait staff. The location allows for quick and easy access. Friendly staff. Beautiful rooms. Wi-Fi and bathroom accessory where plentiful."
3727,SANNY078,5,Great place to stay in Mumbai,I have stayed often on business trips to Mumbai. This is probably one of the best options in the Western suburbs. It is close to the Western Express Highway and all business districts are easily approachable. Rooms are good and well maintained. Check In and Check out is fast and efficient. The breakfast spread is great. There are good options of food here with various restaurants. 
3728,maulikparekh,4,Awesome hotel,"Really very well kept interiors, good and efficient room service. The in room dining menu needs to be expanded. But overall nice experience. Its in city but still on western exp highway, so quite well connected. However if u hav business down south in the city, travelling can b a problem on peak hours. Swimming pool was under maintainance. Bathroom also nice n clean. Very nice place to stay overall!"
3729,John G,4,Extremely efficient for business,"Located in North Mumbai, the hotel is only 10-15 minutes from the airport and within an easy commute (15-25 minutes depending on traffic which can be bad in Mumbai) from the new office district of BKC and other offices.  But if your meetings are in South Mumbai or if you want a feel of historic Mumbai, this is not the best place to stay (try the Oberoi, Trident or Taj).  Overall, hotel functions very well, with an excellent/extensive breakfast and first rate gym.  Modern expansive lobby common areas with rooms which are laid out well."
3730,Dennis M,5,Absolutely a fabulous hotel,"I stayed at this property for two days during my recent trip to India. The hotel is sprawling and immaculate. The property has several restaurants and they are all good, although pricey, however one should expect that if you are staying at a 5 star hotel in Bombay. The room is of good size with all the amenities that you may want from a 5 star hotel. Water bottles, orange peel soaps, nice towels, shaving mirror, tub plus a standing shower and I can go on. The staff is also very pleasant and helpful. The manager at the bar on Saturday night was extremely helpful. They didn't have naan on the menu but we wanted to have some sort of bread with the kababs and he arranged for us to get a fresh hot naan. Thank you! My only complaint is with the concierge service. I think his name was‚Ä¶"
3731,mpindc202,4,Very Nice Hotel,"Visited this property several times this year for business trips.  Very nice experience.  Very close to International airport and nice meeting spaces.   Rooms are very clean and comfortable.  Staff are very attentive and eager to may your stay comfortable.  The gym and pool are very nice, actually the nicest in my many stays in the Mumbai area.   Only drawbacks I have experienced are room noise and weak WiFi. The hallway noises/conversations/door closing seem to echo right through the room doors. Not sure if due to all the marble details (which are beautiful) but rooms can be noisy. My WiFi was always weak, I had to have a booster added to one room and other times I had to call the IT Department and they had to ""adjust"" my WiFi settings?? Great experience otherwise"
3732,Kritika K,5,Luxury at its best... :),I happened to stay here for 3 days in different intervals for a business trip... very nice experience... food is really good... you have 6-8 happy hrs as well to beat your day long meeting tiredness :).... service was very good and staff was really helpful... food is costly though....
3733,Jeremy_SGP,4,Very practical venue,"Closer to airport than downtown Mumbai, this is however a great base to explore the city.  Spacious room, and large enough for wedding or group events, the service and catering was absolutely lovely at the wedding we attended.   Great spa as well with skilled therapists to feel perfectly relaxed after a hectic day in town!"
3734,zabern_w,5,Another Great Experience @ Grand Hyatt,"Excellent service from the arrival till departure. Well trained staff in all areas. Reception, restaurant or Oasis fitness center. I enjoyed the China House, Celinis, 55 East. My room on the 3rd floor was very comfortable including the bed. Fitness center is well equipped."
3735,cathakursingh,5,Wonderful Experience,Very near to airport ... Good ambience...all facilities for a perfect vacation... Juhu beach is also nearby. Health club faculties like steam sauna and jacuzzi were complimentary with stay. Big and clean swimming pool. Quite long time for Heath club... Closes at around 12 so even u can enjoy it after u are done with your day tour...   
3736,Shiva_Speaks,4,As Grand as it can get !!,"It was my first stay at this property and everything about it was Grand and nice. The spacious reception area, fantastic staff to take care made the whole experience very good. Very professional approach by the staff. Rooms were immaculately done and very comfortable. The bar and dining options and ambience was also fantastic. Was fortunate to bump into legendary Kapil Dev in the bar !!!..Food and drink were superb. Very good choice of menu and taste excellent.  Overall a very pleasant stay and would certainly prefer it for another business visit/stay."
3737,ranjanrajeev,4,Good stay,"we had a conference to attend in mumbai and we stayed in grand hyatt which is quite a comfortable and nice hotel. The rooms are modern and well equipped. The food is good and we loved their lavish spread of breakfast, room service though is little slow. Indain restaurant is also quite nice. Overall we had a good stay in grand hyatt mumbai."
3738,traveller904,4,Really good especially for business travelers,"I stayed here for around 3 weeks and enjoyed every bit of my stay here. The service was top notch, as was the cleanliness and the overall decor. Rooms were well kept and the bathrooms were spacious and had a tub etc. The breakfast spread left little to be desired as it encompassed almost anything that one could normally think of, and the waiters were quite attentive and efficient. They have a well equipped gym and a pool which is quite well maintained, although I found the shape to be a bit awkward. Proximity to the airport is quite good (just 4-5 kms or 20 mins) and cabs are easily available via uber etc. One negative is that its in the middle of nowhere in terms of immediate access to good eating joints and pubs etc but then that is reflected in the relatively lower price‚Ä¶"
3739,BrettOnTheRoad,4,If only the Internet worked...,"I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt at least 20 times over the last 2 years. Overall the Grand Hyatt is a solid 5 star hotel performer with superior food options, compared with many other hotels in Mumbai, and well trained, abundant staff at the ready. The hotel is handy to the airport and Bandra in terms of distance however pick your times to travel as the traffic can be horrendous. An evening meal in Bandra can easily be followed by a painful 2 hour return journey to the hotel making the in-house options for dining even more compelling. Luckily, food at the restaurants is consistently excellent. The transport services are expensive but dependable with only 2 issues out of 100's of trips I have done to and from the hotel. The gym is adequate with some electronic machines, circuit‚Ä¶"
3740,madhav n,5,Soviet style US efficiency,"From the inside,the Grand Hyatt seems like a building from Stalin's Russia : austere,huge and with vast areas crisscrossed by corridors. The rooms are free of glitz,they are functional in a stark way but comfortable. Although impersonal if only because of the size, the hotel provides enough locations for meetings,lunches,dinners and conversation. Those looking for a boutique experience,stay away.But if you are comfortable with size, this is the place. Close to the airport but for those needing to go to south Mumbai for meetings,either use the local trains ( offpeak hours,to avoid being crushed) or take along a book or something electronic to while away an hour and more each way"
3741,Shefali P,5,Huge property,"Excellent service throughout the property. We had lounge access and had been assisted by Vishal, Francis, Alex & Yogesh. Rooms are nicely decorated with Japanese style bath & shower area. If they had double hand sinks that would have been great. Our dining experience for breakfast was good. Our server was helpful and the hot food came to the table minutes after it was ordered. We were amazed because it was extremely busy for breakfast. We also had a pleasant dining experience with China House. The food there was amazing. Overall an exceptional stay. THANK YOU"
3742,jswaminat,5,Huge improvement.,I have avoided this hotel for the last 6 years due to poor service in the past. But i must say that they have definitely improved significantly. The reception staff can do some more but that not withstanding the experience was pleasant. The best thing about the hotel is access. It is easy to get to domestic airport as well as highway and is convenient Dont have to waddle through too much traffic. Otherwise the hotel is very much like the other luxury hotels in India.
3743,ZubsZA,5,Grand!!!,"After a 17 hour train journey from Udaipur, the Grand Hyatt was our stopover for a night before our flight the next day. It truly was a magnificent experience. Check in was a breeze and everyone called us by name as soon as we arrived. The room was superb, and had every comfort that we could've imagined. We did have a slight power outage that evening, however the staff were amazing, coming in to sort it out within minutes.  The following morning, the manager, Anubhuti, personally took the time to apologise for the previous evening as well as offer us an airport transfer and an upgrade. It was this small gesture that made us book for a further 2 nights on our return.  With great facilities and even greater people, even though the hotel is a bit of a drive from a lot that Mumbai‚Ä¶"
3744,happy_touristor,5,Good if you're in western Suburbs and want to be close to airport,"Location is not most convenient but being close to airport (not the closest though but max 20min in non peak hours) and also close to BKC complex, about 10-15min drive in peak hours.   Has good room amenities, gym etc. Love it's Chinese restaurant, a must try.   Usually holding parties in weekends so bonus if you bump into the celebrities perhaps. Lol! Overall, recommended for business travelers. "
3745,captainNEERAJ,3,No care,Hyatt the name is great enough for some one for the comfortable stay but the reception service is like they are avoiding the customer the way they treat it make us feel like we are begging a room so please tell your reception staff to have a smile and greet the guest

The ambience is fantastic, rooms are spacious and food is good. Free complimentary wifi at good speeds are an added advantage. Pick up facility is provided, though is pretty costly. Overall a good experience indeed."
3749,dr_alprax,2,A total let-down,"After seeing the fantastic reviews about this place, perhaps I set too high an expectation. I came for a conference for 3 days. Here are my observations.  1. First off, the front desk made us wait for 5 hours from 9am to 2pm citing that check in is only at 2pm. The front desk staff wasn't down right rude, but he was bordering on it with a curt voice full of disdain. 2. The room allotted was small, with a single queen size bed for two of us. (the room was obviously meant for one guest) I can put this down to a cost saving measure. But at least they could have left an extra set of towels and toiletries. The bathroom could not be locked. The tiles were very slippery and getting out after a bath needed a combination of a high wire balance and some luck.  3. There were bouncers at‚Ä¶"
3750,Dr Akash,4,Conference at Hyatt,One of the best place to conduct a conference. Only disadvantage is quality of food is not great and service  Is not that great. But the hall and ambience is just awesome. Good for conducting a crowd of around 500-700 people. Overall a good experience at Hyatt.

Only bit issue is with some staff serving at restaurants which needs to taught the standard expected of the brand they are below.

There is a bit of a rush for checking-in and checking out in the mornings, so budget some time for this.

It was wonderful being able to escape the intense heat of this years Indian summer and we just wanted to be comfortable and to pretty much sit in luxury and relax for a few nights after 5 months of budget accommodation. This seemed the most simple task for the staff of the Hotel, who went so far to ensure that we were comfortable, happy and catered for. After stating the purpose of our trip there as a couple, the bathroom was transformed into an art piece with rose petals and lovely soaps. The food was exquisite, the rooms spotless and the staff provided more than we could have asked for. A special remark for one of the young workers/waiters Aaron,‚Ä¶"
3770,ALdnM54,4,"Clean, comfortable, amazing staff","We stayed here for two nights to enjoy a quick trip in Mumbai. The hotel isn't in the best locations as it's quite far from the beach front and main tourist attractions. It is also close to a slum/poor area but if you have a driver this shouldn't be an issue.   The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Little can be criticised here. The staff go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and you really feel the 5* quality shine through in their hospitality. The pool is also very nice and open until 10pm which is great for some r&r after a day in the city as is the gym, spa area.   One thing I will say is that the hotel is so huge, the restaurant areas sometime feel like canteens. I also ate at one of their restaurants one evening (the Italian one) and got food poisoning‚Ä¶"
3771,Titus K,4,Good business hotel conveniently located,"Its a good business hotel conveniently & centrally located to reach the Airport or BKC. Neat rooms of good size. Very modern and comfortable. Breakfast buffet is excellent, a great combination of Asian, Indian and European dishes.  In-room service, Meet & Greet service is just ordinary. Not as exceptional as a Taj or Oberoi. Overall a good one, if you are here just for business / transit stay."

Centrally located, not too far from the airport and major attractions nearby it scores highly over other hotels in terms of location. I was fortunate that my stay was sponsored by my company and I really made good use of all the available resources. Food was good, but what stood out is the ambience and good experience I had. Thanks guys."
3773,KulendraJ,4,Very luxurious,"Was here for a two day visit that in had to schedule quite unexpectedly. The hotel is no doubt luxurious; the restaurant at the the ground floor is probably the best with a fusion of Indian as well as western food. I stayed in a club room which was very spacious. Club quarters members also get access to the club restaurant which has it's own breakfast spread, 24/7 tea and assortments and 6pm-8pm cocktails.   The hotel is quite pricey and the travel arrangements from the hotel are equally pricey. If you need to travel anywhere take what they call a Cool cab (which starts with the price specified upfront) or best, Uber."

The very rich who live there go around in Rolls Royce Silver Shadows while a large number of beggars and homeless people can be seen at every street corner. The Hyatt is surrounded by high walls and has armed guards that check every vehicle that wants to enter its perimeter. Once you are inside Bombay is far away. No outside noise, luxurious floors and tapestries. Well groomed uniformed staff is there to discretely look after you even if truly impersonal regardless of their perennial smiles. This Hyatt is at the same level as the ones in Istanbul or Mexico City and probably is as good as many others. Great room, great amenities, excellent food.

The breakfast team are efficient and provide great personal service. They remembered my name from day 1 which always makes a guest feel a little extra special especially in a large scale hotel.  i will never stay anywhere else in Mumbai. Grand Hyatt will always be the best.  The Soma‚Ä¶"

Even better hospitality, fantastic breakfast and China House rocks....Duty manager Gaurav goes out of the way to please the hotel customers....Concierge services of this hotel is par excellent [ would specially like to mention Saurab's name for outstanding services ]  Keep it up Grand Hyatt mumbai...."
3784,Khaled S,5,I wish all hotels were like the Grand Hyatt Mumbai... seriously!,"The Grand Hyatt Mumbai has kept me coming back again and again. The hotel is stylish and sophisticated enough to appeal to anyone who likes charm, excellent service, yet its modern enough to appeal to a 30-40 something and chiq enough for a 20 something looking for a venue with a top nightclub (China Lounge) and easy access to the local area.  	 	This time I booked a club room on the 4th floor for 4 nights ‚Äì the service, as always, was incredible. All of the employees were welcoming, polite and above all, intelligent ‚Äì its hard to believe all of the employees here have university degrees and have been trained to the highest standards.  	 	The Club Lounge is a welcome treat for anyone who wants a quiet breakfast or just to relax somewhere for a few hours ‚Äì well worth paying to‚Ä¶"
3785,Sola1008,2,Room with NO WINDOW,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for one night in October to attend a medical conference. A separate check in was provided for delegates near the conference area which was clumsy and time consuming. Was advised by the receptionist that the room assigned to me was in an area of the hotel which was under renovation and that the window had been closed by wooden boards due to repairs outside. An alternate (normal) room would be available only in the late afternoon. Since I was attending the conference as faculty and needed to change clothes and prepare for my talks the same afternoon, I had no choice but to take what was available and plan to change rooms when I was free.  Without a window and natural sunlight, the room seemed dark and claustrophobic. A large wooden board had been placed‚Ä¶"
3786,krishnartw,5,Gorgeous hotel with great service!,"The location is a bit out of the way, but the hotel itself was fabulous and close to the airport.  As well, there were enough cab companies that were willing to come here so it was not an issue.    When i checked in the room type i had booked was no longer available.  They graciously upgraded my room and included free morning buffet everyday! If you have a chance please try the buffet brunch, they have food from all over the world.  The line up can be a little long.  Gym facilities are large and spacious and the massage was very relaxing.  Room itself was spacious and comfortable.  Overall, very pleased with the hotel and level of service."
3787,ZahidaV,5,IN TRUE SENSE GRAND!,"Absolutely beautiful and well managed hotel. The porters and the front line staff are very courteous. The food is very pricey. We often took cool cab to BKC to eat at the Pizza Express which makes amazing pizza. I have to point out the porters UMESH and NABAL SINGH for their awesome customer service. We stayed at this hotel for 8 days and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. One of the things that was impressive was, we mentioned to the housekeeping that our bed was too hard, when we arrived in the afternoon, our mattress was changed. The other thing I must mention is, the staff at the front desk are very courteous and helpful. They always carried a smile and welcome each guest with great enthusiasm. This hotel has a boutique salon, I decided to get a haircut on my last day with‚Ä¶"

3789,Ankit S,5,No,Amazine food and good hospitality.  I order 4-5 item sach a good test and presention is something  different. ....... specialy i take vegetarian food. And staff is also good...  rooms  are also good. Cleaning is good.
3790,Stephen K,4,India Business Trip,Nice spacious rooms and located a short distance from airport and business districts. Staff nice and friendly rooms clean and nice and quite rooms. Amenities were good and plenty of resturants to choose from.
3791,raghavendra_kk,5,Business Hotel,"Best business hotel I would recommend in Mumbai. stayed here on every visit of mine to Mumbai, the hospitality has been the best. The hotel had an issue with Wi-Fi during my visit, hopefully it was an one time affair and can be ignored."
3792,marco_polo6107,4,Convenience in Mumbai,"I have recently been staying at Grand Hyatt Mumbai, standard room. The room is big enough to feel confortable but some renovation is generally needed, spacious bathroom with all needed amenities, breakfast assortement is quite complete, the gym is spacious and the devices are good. Several restaurants available in the area of the lobby. Generally speaking the environment is clean and safe, the hotel is not far feom the International airport, a bit more far away from the city centre.the staff if friendly and professional, a good place to stay for business. Good value for money."
3793,Vignesh215,4,Business hotel with good hospitality,"My wife and I were on a shopping trip to Mumbai. We chose grand Hyatt as it is the closest to the airport and the main highway. We stayed at the club floor. The pick up from the airport was very smooth and efficient. Check in was very quick and we were escorted to our room. Room is large and comfortable. All the amenities were complete in the room and I must say we r pleased with the services. For breakfast the club lounge is limited so we had our breakfast at the Lower ground. Terrific choices and we really enjoyed our breakfast. Service is prompt and efficient .  We had room service ordered from China , it was very good food.   Drop off to airport was efficient and comfortable , we stayed 6 nights and we are very pleased with grand Hyatt Mumbai. Nice and comfortable hotel‚Ä¶"
3794,darshit m,5,Ask yourself what do you want in an Hotel and this answers it all....! :),When you ask yourself about what you want in an Hotel there are a few answers you will get   1) Good Locality  2) Delicious Food  3) Nice Tidy rooms  4) Great Hospitality   And guess what. Grand Hyatt Answers it all.   Just a 10 mins drive from international airport. Lovely breakfast.   And i am glad they started free Wifi at the Hotel which was not there previously.   Thumbs up for GH
3795,uki_05,3,2 night stay,"Stayed at room 2168 for 2 nights in Jan 2015. Join the q and upon reaching my turn, was directed to a separate floor for check in asreservation made was for club room. Room is just next to club lounge and noises could be heard from 5-6am due to staff preparing for the breakfast crowd. If you are a light sleeper, this is not the room to stay."
3796,Ankush16,5,Excellent Stay Again!!,"You cant go wrong with Grand Hyatt in Mumbai. This was my second stay at this hotel and was a pleasant experience again. Being a Hyatt Platinum, we were upgraded to the Club room with Lounge Access. The exceptional hospitality & service is best part of this hotel. Will visit again.."
3797,Ajay R,5,A home away from home,"Visited Mumbai for 3 weeks with my family (parents, wife and 2 y/o)and had the pleasure of staying at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai.  Since we were here for an extended stay we opted for the residences, which i'd highly recommend for anyone looking for a home away from home.  The 2BR residence was perfectly appointed, complete w/ a fully functional large kitchen.  While the hotel itself represented itself well, it was the staff that truly made the difference.  Rodney Vaz & Jagruti Socher (at 55 East Restaurant) and Imrajeet Singh (at Soma) were some of the most genuine, and exceptional people i have had the pleasure of interacting with (and i travel a ton - for work & pleasure).  Our stay included daily breakfast, and Rodney & Jagruti repeatedly went above and beyond the call of duty‚Ä¶"
3798,JitinBindlish,3,Average architecture but wonderful staff and food,Grand Hyatt Mumbai is built like a square where internal room face each other over the open area that has stairs and balconies... I was given internal room with a view of other rooms...  some welding work was going on so anyways it was a bit disturbing there. Food in breakfast as well as in room service was awesome.. had good variety in buffet and delicious preparations. Staff was very friendly and hospitality was good.  Room was pretty comfortable and spacious. Only inconvenience was the view from room as it was a boring view so had to keep my room curtains ON all the time ... would suggest management to bring some colorful lights / water bodies in the internal side since you can't change architecture.
3799,sandrine c,4,Valuable for business stay,You should ensure that you choose your room correctly as thehotel tend sometime not to offer immediatly best options. But finally rooms are usually very nice and comfortable. Very good and profesional services and the hotel offers several valuable lunch or dinner options
3800,sameer_cool,4,Value for money,They have offer of the day which makes it value for money. If you stay regular or are member then you can get upgraded to the club room. Buffet breakfast is wide spread. Chinese restaurant is also good.
3801,Nesiie,4,Nice place near airport,"So, we have spent 7 nights at Grand Hyatt. As my husband has Platinum Hyatt Status they upgraded our room, so we had nice garden view, free newspaper and water, fruit... Stuff is very polite and helpful. Room was nice and spacious also, bathroom was also nice with tube and shower. Although must say that carpet looked a little bit old, and the whole hotel had a little strange odor. Ok, must admit, it is not the Oberoi, and forget that you will be welcomed with people in traditional clothes but If you are looking for decent place to stay, it is totally Hyatt hotel and just book it. Must admit; I was suspicious because I had read here about rooms without windows etc.. but we had actually large ceiling to floor window. Also, the pool is under maintenance and it will be for a longer‚Ä¶"
3802,Viswaprakash M,5,Excellent place to stay,"On our arrival onto Mumbai Airport terminal, We were greeted by Hotel Chauffeured cars (again booked prior to our arrival) and took care of Check-In. No flaw or bad remarks comment. Food, accommodation and Service were excellent. I can see one thought in terms of customers, where if ATM machine was available would have been very useful. I didn't had any Indian currency on arrival and had to use the card most of the time on my stay at Grand Hyatt. I would prefer to go once again when I get another chance when visiting Mumbai."
3803,VishalHarlalka,4,Great hospitality,"Well, Grand Hyatt!! Nothing to comment as the name says it all. But the only inconvenience was the swimming pool which is under maintenance and we had to go to the residence pool which is at some distance."
3804,jason Z,5,Great hotel and amenities,"Easily my favorite hotel. We have been here twice now in a span of a year. The basics are outstanding (checkin in painless, rooms are emmaculately clean, staff is exceedingly friendly). The rooms are modern, big, clean, and in excellent condition. Wi-Fi is free, and you get complimentary water, fruit, and chocolates upon arrival and sometimes when they clean your room. They offer an outstanding breakfast buffet combining indian cuisine with western classics (highly recommended). To save money, we don't typically stay at 5 star hotels, but this one is priced unbelievably well. Even the art/decor inside the hotel is beautiful. I'd recommended this hotel a thousand times over to anyone visiting Mumbai."
3805,Ani J,4,Great hotel with close proximity to the airport,"I stayed at this hotel last month on two separate occasions. The first time we were upgraded to a fancy suite, and the second time we were in a regular room. I have reviewed both my experiences here.  One of the things I have noticed at 5-star hotels in India, is that the front desk staff assumes how your name should be spelled. My husband's last name is 'Muzumdar'. Even when he spelled it out alphabet by alphabet, the front desk staff wrote 'Majumdar'. I mean come on....the least you can do it listen to what the guest is saying. So a note for the management team - please train the front desk staff to listen and take the names seriously.  Also, the second time around, the check-in took forever. Even my sister-in-law, who lives in India found the lady checking us in to be too‚Ä¶"
3806,Nipun S,5,Awesome place and food,The trip was attending a conference. This place is so good. The interiors are done very tastefully and you can see the moment you enter the hotel. The food was awesome and so was the service. Overall a fantastic place to have business meeting and even stay. It is very close to the airport too. About 20 minutes maximum.
3807,VINITA0712,1,Most disgusting experience i ever had in my life !!,"The hotel as such is good, food is also fine but the service part is terrible !!! Specially the front office and cashiers !!! I booked 3 rooms in this hotel with credit card guarantee, I got confirmation notes. I also booked a banquet hall as we had a event in this hotel. Every day in my inbox there were 3 cancellation emails of those 3 rooms. I presumed hotel was sold out and they were cancelling rooms of the guests to get more rooms but how can they cancel guaranteed rooms without guests information. No one takes ownership of the problems and ever time new face and new names contacts who pens down the problem and goes away !! I believe they are not able to manage this hotel, as it is a very big property !! This was not the end of the story, one of the guest who was earlier‚Ä¶"
3808,MrLeonBoland,5,A must stay... Great hotel!,"What a fantastic hotel... Grand as per the name, grand with the service!  I am a Diamond member and the Hyatt Club Lounge is a must to upgrade to... Good choice and staff are fantastic... So helpful especially Karan Sharma who is there on all my stays and even remembers my name!!! Even though the stays can be months apart!  Food is always fab, sooo much choice and rooms are fantastic, clean and spacious!   My only downfalls are the rooms near the small road next to the hotel can be a little noisy from 7am - 10pm so if your working shifts and need to sleep in the day request a room away from this or higher up and you can sometimes here the planes going to the airport (but hey not an issue as its not a 24 hour airport as such!)  The pool is ok but not very 'grand' compared to most‚Ä¶"
3809,Tnv K,5,Luxurious Hotel,"This is one of the best luxurious hotels i have ever visited in Mumbai. Though I have not visited Taj, this one really amazed me by its ambiance. This is also centrally located and well connected with all modes of transportation."
3810,Lopaaaaa,3,Terrific loction,"the best part about this hotel is its proximity to the International airport. The ambience and room was also very good. Service was excellent though the food can be improved, given the price one is paying"
3811,Kalpesh G,4,Goes by hyatt standards,"A very good hotel in all terms. I arrived early for my check in but inspite of calling the hotel in advance, my room wasnt ready. Unfortunately, there was a doctor's convention which was checking in and there were no more rooms available which was a disappointment. After 1 hr, they decided to give me a serviced apartment. Amenities otherwise are all good. They have a good pool, gym, excellent restaurants and it even has a shopping mall. Didnt have any other difficulty except for the delayed check in. Location is a bit off but it is still worth the travel if you are going to check in to enjoy the amenities of the hotel."
3812,ShrikantWakharkarTWC,5,peking duck at china house,"China House serves the best Peking Duck in the country. Period.  The bird is roasted to perfection, skin deliciously crisp and the accompaniments are perfect. Pancakes are as thin as can be.   The cr√®me brulee with home made coconut ice cream is great to end the meal."
3813,Amit B,4,Amit Bhandari,Excellent location! Food was good Rooms were big and clean.Service was also prompt and staff were really helpful and polite. Swimming pool was small as compare to hotel size.overall stay was very comfortable and room tariff was also very reasonable for a 5* hotel. 
3814,acukiert,4,Good option if your convention is running in their convention center,This is a good option if your business meeting is at the hotel. Check-in and out uneventful. Rooms a little bit run-down. Good international restaurant. Good wi-fi connection. The property is located in a bad neighbourhood and far from the main tourist attraction (it took us 75 minutes to get to Gate of India)
3815,Stantman67,4,Stayed in this hotel during a AWS Event,"The hotel is around 15 minutes away from the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport.  The hotel compound is huge when you check in.  Before you enter the hotel as usual you will be subjected to person and baggage checked.  Check in is quick and fuss free.  The room is spacious with a nice bathroom.  Amenities are ok, housekeeping had the room upkept very well.  The hotel is a good distance away from the city center.  "

3817,AbhishekTiwariMum,5,A stay well Remembered,"I always wishes to visit a 5 Star hotel, and always wondered how the stay and their hospitality services will be  And finally the day has arrived when i had witnessed that, when i entered i was been welcome so nicely along with welcome drink  The rooms make you feel you are been living in a palace the food is so delicious.  Have tried different variety of food and liked very much, even been able to use the wifi service, which make my work easy and did not faced any issue  Will definitely plan my another trip soon, so that can live my dream again."
3818,Graeme P,4,"Nice hotel, rooms a bit tired","Stayed here for 2 nights. I arrived late and was ""upgraded"" to the residences which are the serviced apartments within the hotel. Although the 1 bedroom apartment was large, it felt tired and was only average in terms of furnishing and finishes compared to the hotel rooms which I usually stay in.  The restaurants and bar within the hotel are very good. For those with offices at BKC it is a good option. I'll certainly stay again, just pass on the Residences upgrade next time."
3819,Seema V,5,Joyful experience by Big League Life Style,Excellent three night stay at the Grand Hyatt hotel Mumbai by bLL .We highly recommend to stay as it has great location.The staff is professional and efficient.  The hotel is superb with variety of restaurants a luxurious fitness centre and swimming pool. Easy access to airport other areas.  Thanks to bll It was real pleasure to have stayed here.
3820,Venkatesh T,3,"Luxurious business hotel, conveniently located","Really convenient location close to the airport  At check-in, since i wanted a no-smoking zone, the person asked if i was ok with a room which had no windows. I do not have any issues, so accepted, but was strange to see rooms being built without windows and also not pleasant to be the first impression about the hotel. Otherwise room was really nice, though the light switches proved to be a bit complicated to shut off all the lights. Wi-fi was very poor -  apparently there was some work going on Bathroom was awesome - one of the best available in business hotels Breakfast was good : though a bit chaotic, with waiters bringing me twice plates ordered by someone else. ."
3821,Avininder,5,Comfortable place,A nice spacious hotel with large rooms and a good location of you have business around the new commercial hub of Mumbai BKC is not far. Nor does one have to run the gauntlet of traffic after arriving at the airport.
3822,PK88,1,Room with NO WINDOW,"I usually like Hyatt properties - but i was given a room with NO WINDOW.  It felt extremely claustrophobic.  To the hotel's credit, when i complained, they offered me a 20% discount - which is nice, but if if were any earlier than midnight, i would have sought other accommodation.  I was told the only rooms with widows that were available were smoking rooms.  Horrible.  Why would they even put a guest in a room like this is beyond me.  I typically sleep with the curtains drawn open as the morning light helps me to wake.  I will not stay in this hotel again uless i get a guaranteed room with a window."
3823,rukesh2014,5,Yet another grand,"This time I'm writing review on Grand Hyatt , Mumbai , not only this hotel is good , but they have improved upon their services and amenities, since 2009 , this was my 4th visit to the hotel , and I have felt that in house amenities are much better than what it was earlier , rooms are better equipped , food is excellent , improved Indian taste , gim and staff , special name Justin , very much helpful , my special thanks to him, all in all Excellent. 10-15 minutes from domestic airport , by road ."
3824,RajeevKK15,4,Very Good Service,Stayed here for 3 nights last week and was impressed with the level of service. From the check in to the bell boys to the waiters in the restaurant all the staff were courteous. Though I must mention that the rooms are average and in need of some renovation. Overall good. 
3825,Karl A,4,Disappointing start but good finish,"This is a good hotel just annoyed at a clearly over booked hotel and first nigh a room without windows, next night I would be shifted but when the time came can not do. Kicked up a bit of a stink and after lots of discussion got moved to a suite. Whilst the hotel and management redeemed itself it left a bad taste. Value on the other hand good, food fine"
3826,MadhumitaGhosh,5,Indeed very grand,"One of the best hotels in the Western suburbs, the best part is the location and proximity to the airport. Try out their exotic buffet breakfast or just spend a few hours while striking that business deal in their aromatic coffee shop. This property has all the qualities for making you come back for more."
3827,Omkar P,5,Business,"Mumbai is big. this is the city  where people never sleeps ..   One of my fav place in the world.   And there are many place in Mumbai.  I love to visit every time .. Like gateway io india , Chowpatty Beach ,Haji Ali,Juhu Beach,Marine Drive. With the  help of "" trip advisor "" app  i had a great time in india.."

3829,RamanBhatia85,4,Luxury,Great hotel with spacious rooms. Try Soma hotel - restaurant serves amazingly delicious Indian food. Swimming pool is better than the other hotels. Hotel also has a shopping mall with local as well as multinational brands
3830,possuminpandaland,5,"Spacious, comfortable, quiet. A retreat from the busy-busyness, outdoors !","Close to airport (no noise though). Definitely a good fit for seasoned business persons, working this end of Bombay. (otherwise a long commute to Colaba).  Fab in-house restaurants. Spacious internal areas to lounge and entertain colleagues.   Rooms excellent. Separate living/ bedroom areas a bonus. Club-Lounge a little dull (visually) - but well patronized. Go early."
3831,anythingtodeclare,3,Good hotel,The trick in Mumbai is to find somewhere in a convenient location. I was told this was but it felt a long way out of town near airport. Rooms ok but no view. Service very good except drive way. Lots of staff standing around doing nothing talking to each other. You had to step around them continuously to get in or out. Not overly friendly at this point either   Room well appointed and what you expect. No more no less. Restaurant good  arm not working this is a problem because you then need to find an ATM somewhere else. Cash is king in Mumbai. Would stay again however I have been told that paying a little more gets a big increase in standard. 
3832,MainePeg,4,"Great Indian food, friendly staff","Spent nearly a week here for a conference. The Indian food was fantastic and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Hotel is is great shape. I stayed on the top floor in a lovely room, and had sweeping views of  corporate buildings, the university and slums in the distance (they seem to be everywhere). My one downside is that I felt restricted to the hotel grounds, as there is nothing nearby for safely walking, to exercise for example, and I didn't feel safe leaving the grounds alone. All in all a great experience."
3833,KelIndia,5,I love the Shower,"I stay in a lot of hotel rooms .... you can tell by the number of reviews ....... But I do love the GHM, it is understated, has great service, great room, wonderful mattress ...... but the best bit is definitely the show ...... hot hot water, will blast you past the bathtub ...... Awesome.  More costly but worth the money."
3834,Mehul N,5,AMAZING STAY,It was a wonderful stay. As expected grate hospitality and comfort of class. Nice buffet spread breakfast. Enjoyed every moment. Go for rooms on higher floors depending on the room type booked. weekends rates are cheaper than weekday
3835,Zebas B,5,One of the best hotels I have ever visited,"It is not cheap, but it is amazing. It has all the amenities you could dream of, great restaurants, good food, good service, it is well located. They even helped my girlfriend with her new sari. Overall we had an AMAZING stay."
3836,indiancamp,5,Surpassed my expectations,"At the price I paid for this hotel, I can truly say that this is the best value hotel I have ever stayed in. The hotel exceeded my expectations in every department. The staff were fantastic and the rooms were superb.  This is mainly a business hotel so don't go expecting 'old Raj' d√©cor. Everything is crisp and modern. I didn't have dinner at the restaurant but the breakfast in the caf√© was great for the price. Only one improvement the hotel could make is to their airport transfer service. At 2500 Rs plus taxes for a very short journey, I feel this is too expensive."
3837,OrvarDraken,4,Good hotel in North Mumbai,"If business takes you to stay in North Mumbai; to avoid the crazy traffic, the Hyatt is a good choice.  While the guys are a bit tired, the stay is pleasant and good Well appointed gym  Great selection of foods  The only challenge is its so 'low' (compared to other local hotels), the noise at night is noticeable (dogs, people and cars). "
3838,Nupur1310,5,Best,It was the best stay away from my home.. It was excellent. The staff there were soooooo cooperative and excellent service was provided by them.. They have the best party at their lounge. CHINA LOUNGE. Perfect hotel
3839,Meshwa T,3,Not Impressed,We originally had a reservation for 2 nights but only stayed one night. The room was very clean and but water from the shower leaked into our room.  Half of the room had water all the over the carpet. I was not happy with the way the management handled the situation. None acknowledged the trouble we had to go through even at check out. There are better hotels in Mumbai.
3840,Michael D,5,A testament to wonderful architecture & granduer,"An amazing property, take time to absorb the fine architecture this property has. The staff is professional and efficient with what I would consider the finest cuisine there is to offer. It was a real pleasure to have stayed here with great location making it both easy to commute to the city and to the various suburbs."

3842,Prabha,5,Luxury at its best!!,"Me and my husband went for a one night stay at the Hyatt over the weekend. The whole idea was to just take a break from the normal busy life and spend time with each other. Must say that the experience was truly much more than expected. The hotel is definitely grand, the service is par excellence, the swimming pool is amazing. The overall experience of staying at this Hyatt Property was grand."
3843,Lutchman2015,4,A grand and gracious experience,A grand hotel as the name suggests. Magnificent rooms and spacious comfortable space. A luxurious fitness centre and swimming pool. Easy access to airport and other ares. Pleasant bar and rest in the hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful.

3845,Kiran K,5,Lives up to brand,"Very near international airport.  Hotel very well maintained and staff were helpful and polite.   Rooms were beautiful with comfortable beds and a big bathroom.  Their buffet breakfast had a good range to choose from as well!   Would highly recommend having dinner at their restaurant called Soma, they probably serve the best tandoori chicken.   Had a pleasant stay!"

3852,Wdn F,4,Serviced Apartments made for families,My children aged 6&10 hadn't really stayed in Mumbai before & this time it was for 4 weeks. Our serviced apartment on the 5th floor overlooked the tennis court area. It had a balcony but we barely used due to the heat. All housekeeping and concierge staff were very good and attentive. I particularly found the baby sitting service very good with their variety of planned activities. The swimming pool was fantastic and gym had a good variety of equipment. The design of keeping the serviced apartments connected to the main hotel was superb as it was liveky and had a great atmosphere. Do try out their art tour of in house artefacts as well. The location is excellent and near the airport but do not venture out on foot.  We enjoyed the Hyatt extremely. We will hope to go back soon.
3853,Le V,1,"If you expect a function stable Internet, stay away","in order not to write this review having only one stay in mind, i accumulated 3 stays in the past two month. Funny enough i was told again and again that only the room i stayed in had some internet issues. I have to say.... for whatever reason the Inet comes and goes. I involved my local IT guy to see if i do something wrong, yet he confirmed all good on my side. You are pretty close to the ITC which is close to this Hotel. If you try to work at the Grand Hyatt, choose a plan from the ITC. At first it seems that the wifi signal is far weaker then the one you can choose from the Hyatt, yet the ITC offers you double of the Speed. The Hyatt tried several times to send someone up to my room, not sure what for, yet there was no solution. Maybe next time i should stay at the ITC or‚Ä¶"
3854,Prianca V,4,Staycation delight,"It had been a couple of particularly hard weeks at work for both of us. After going through the motions of the Friday night party and Saturday hopping art galleries, one really needed to unwind.  On a lark I suggested checking into a hotel. In no time we had booked the Hyatt's awesome weekend package and checked in.  Needless to say, the service was spot on. The stay also introduced me to the First Essentials line of products.   The staff is prompt and I've been to the hotel plenty of times before to know their food is too die for.  All in all, this was just the break I yearned for!"
3855,Vivaan G,4,Consistently good,I've been staying at this hotel for many years now and have seen this hotel consistently keep high service standards. This is quite a popular hotel so the lobby is always abuzz. This is conveniently located close to the airport which is a  boon given how unpredictable traffic can be in a place like Mumbai. There are many dining options as well - China House being my favorite.

Nothing has changed from what I remember - a great hotel with everything especially effortlessly sublime service. 3 instances that stuck in mind were doormen knowing your name when you arrive from a late night airport pickup, to a driver asking your permission to give some invaluable opinions on your househunting efforts.  The decor (though I'm sure it's been updated) still seems just the right blend of modern and classic. The rooms are well sized, with all the comforts to be expected from a hotel of this class.

3862,DT94024,5,An Oasis in the Buzzing Mumbai,I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai in August on a business trip.  This was my first time back at the hotel after almost 7 years.  I had fond memories of its services and delicious food from 7 years ago and was quite looking forward to another wonderful experience.  Well I wasn't disappointed.  The service was impeccable.  The food was excellent.  The Grand Club staff was very attentive too. The only complaint I have was with the driver of hotel car that took me to the airport.  He started talking about his pay and comparing what Hyatt pays him to what he earned as a taxi driver.  He *reminded* me that he really is paid with tips.  I felt bad that my short trip to Mumbai had ended with an unpleasant experience in the nice hotel car.

I know that the check in time is at 2 pm but on availability of room it can be given early also. I was told on reception that I will get my room in 45 min. to 1 hour, but I got my room at 1.45 pm after many reminders. I had come for a serious business matters. It wasted my 3 hours. If I had been intimated that I will get a room at 2pm only then I could have left my luggage and could have gone for my business meeting immediately and could have taken the room in the evening after coming back.

Secluded in a kind of compound, at about 15 minutes drive from the Mumbai airport, this hotel is a massive luxurious property. The lobby is huge but pretty well organized with different bars, restaurants and the front desk area with plenty of sofas to relax during check in procedures. However, thanks to a very efficient and kind staff, it never takes too long and you will be soon escorted to your room.

Additionally, you can't walk down a hallway without being greeted by several staff members. On several occasions, a staff member rode in the elevator with me and struck up a conversation asking whether they could do anything more to make my stay better.

Very well maintained, albeit I am not a huge fan of carpets in the rooms  in a tropical climate!  Good selection of restaurants and cafes, interesting menus and well presented and prepared food. The staff are friendly and helpful. But it is a busy hotel always events and conventions = lots of people, but as this is generally during the day it isn't an issue for the guests. Definitely I will use it again when I have to work in Navi Mumbai, it ticks all the boxes although it won't be the most memorable hotel stay of your life!"

Last time I fell sick and had to check out, but could not due to bad health. I had asked for the doctor and he spoke to me on phone and came on time. The doctor is a very nice person. However the initial reaction of the staff when I asked them to extend my stay was ""No sir we are running full"", but eventually they spoke to the manager and extended my stay.

3873,Prateek P,3,Good Business Hotel!,"Was staying in the property for one night. Excellent value for money as i was booked under the 50% promotion for the month. Clean, spacious & hygienic rooms, nothing to complain about, although the service to the room is quite slow. The hotel has some of the best restaurants so you wont feel the need to dine out, whether its for indian, chinese or italian. The night club attached to the China House restaurant is fantastic with Bollywood Night's on Friday's, a must go.  The only drawback would be the vibrations felt in the room from the banquets below, it can get quite irritating if you are looking to crash early."

Where in 2-3 attempts also the message was not been cleared, i arrived at the hotel hoping room is been booked under my name, but it never happened. Some how i meet a sensible duty manager who helped me clearing doubts and getting a room and billing was done, then and there.

Happened to stay here since we had meetings scheduled here.  This is a large property in really the middle of nothing exciting - however not too far from either the airport or the BKC/Bandra area. Nothing to do in the immediate vicinity.  Got upgraded to a Suite which was large but never felt like anything special. Had all the amenities including a high end coffee machine (they forgot to keep the capsules in the room and had to ask for some) but I found the decor and lighting very dull.

It takes too long to get to rooms with no signage to help you on the way. In fact, no signage anywhere. You get out of your taxi and there is no one to show you to reception. Then you try to find the pool and you find yourself walkking through a conference area in your bathrobe. Its just too big, with no service to back it up. The restaurant and bar staff are professional so for business, thse areas were fine. Oh, and the pool is great for lane swimming but the fact I ran into a dead bird during my swim just shows that you simply can't give attention to detail in such a big place.

If you want to wander to the 'more colorful' parts of Bombay, they are just blocks away.  The hotel is guarded and gated, so it's very safe, and clean."

No where you get that much as you will be confused.The Dinner was expensive, but once we had it it was worth more than what we have paid for. the staff in the restaurant was taking care of us, as to in no way we could find any fault anywhere. The check in and check out also did not took 5 minutes. that also was fast. To get a cab there was hardly any delay from the exit gate. Everything superb. Hatts off to the team and the management."
3916,Rakesh Mehta,5,Great place to stay for International Transit Passengers,I stayed for two nights but I found this place as worth for International Transit passengers as it is close to both airport terminals. It has a magnificent lobby. My stay was with a complementary night due to their celebration sale. Always look for such promotion that give a good value for your money.
3917,KismetJewellNakai,5,Happy stay!,It's hard to differentiate yourself in this competitive world of main stream hotels.They usually all seem to be the same and nothing extraordinary. I can't say the same for the Grand Hyatt. I stayed there for 3 nights recently and was pleasantly surprised by how helpful and professional the staff was there. The breakfast buffet is great and you want to eat everything ! I loved the size of the fitness centre-it is so large and airy compared to tiny dingy hotel gyms you usually see.  The hotel is always busy whether it is flight crew arriving at odd times or a wedding taking place but it never affected any aspects of the service. I really enjoyed my stay there and would go back in a jiffy.
3918,9girip,5,The best hotel in India. Hands down.,"It was perfect. Cant ask for more. Would love to stay there whenever I visit Mumbai in future. Best in India.  Dont miss lunch buffet. Soups are the best. You pick any item, you cant go wrong.  Rooms are awesome with great views.              "
3919,Akhilesh97,4,Awesome Experience,Definitely one of the best 5 stars in the city. I've been to Mumbai before and I regret having chosen other 5 stars over Grand Hyatt before. Everything here is an epitome of how hotels should function.
3920,nishu444,4,One of the Marquee Properties Of Hyatt Group in Mumbai..,Grand Hyatt Mumbai is a very large and spacious Hotel with courteous staff and clean and Good Ambient Feeling..Rooms are Properly appointed with good set of Freshers Kit thrown in..And Food is Awesome in Most of the Restaurants particularly China House..But had one complaint dat the once great Shopping Plaza operational in Hyatt has or is gonna be vanished as only Few Shops were left now..Rates are Particularly favourable according to Mumbai Standards..Highly Recommend for Discerning Busniess Traveller...
3921,himanshu626,4,Awesome place for business travellers,"stayed in club room for a night, room was comfortable with all necessary ammenities. Great ambience, very courteous, polite and caring staff. The buffet for lunch/dinner is a must have, huge multicusine spread."
3922,Senior1_Traveller,5,Visit to Mumbai,"We put up at The Grand Hyatt Mumbai because we had an early morning flight and we wanted to avoid the Mumbai traffic. There are a few other hotels in the vicinity like the ITC Maratha, Hilton, etc. There are also several corporate offices nearby, but no good restaurants. We had our dinner at the ground floor restaurant and were very impressed with the quality of food. This hotel seems to be very popular with airline crew because we saw the crew of several airlines having their breakfast at the ground floor restaurant. The breakfast buffet spread was fantastic."
3923,David_and_Kerstin,4,Good Indian hospitality,"We stayed for 2 nights in adjoining rooms. The rooms were fine & the beds very comfortable. Bathrooms came well equipped with all amenities & the view was nice. Windows could have been a bit cleaner, though. The hotel appears to have had its hayday about 5 years ago & everything was a bit dated, but clean. The pool outside was fabulous, although a bit on the mossy side in spots. It was incredible to lie back & see the birds & enormous bats that came by after dark. Service was good, but Saurabh (Concierge) stood out in being absolutely fantastic. He knew the right restaurants to go to & also arranged for transport."
3924,Toneal J,5,Amazing Experience!,"We stayed for 3 nights and were totally blown away with the VIP treatment we received! From check in to check out our stay was lovely. Staff are all friendly and very professional. High tea in the lobby was an experience and dinner in the Italian restaurant was delicious. The canapes in the grand club were really yummy and creative! Breakfast was great, a huge variety, catering for all nationalities! Service was excellent excellent in all areas we visited including housekeeping and the tailor services that saved the day for me! Thank you to all who made our stay a memorable one."
3925,sushovan_majumder,4,Business trip,Stay was part of annual business meet. Rooms are pretty good and also the recreation facilities are worth mentioning. Close proximity to the domestic airport makes it an ease for us to stay at this hotel. Food except breakfast was not upto the mark and not in line with the standard of this hotel. Desserts was however yummy. Overall stay is good but not happy with the food.
3926,Sharan68,4,Good Hotel,"Had stayed here in the month of May 2015 with family and few other friends . Had a good time here . Though was a short visit of only one day . The check in formalities took a while , the on duty receptionist was apparently not in good mood . But anyway we got our room . The food was quite good. Wi fif was free. Kids did use the pool and enjoyed themselves. Overall , a good stay."
3927,sansub11,4,Thank you Grand Hyatt!!,Great ambience..Good food....But to top it all the staff is very warm.. Not once did we find anyone not smiling or greeting you. My 7 month old baby was made comfortable at every stage which was my biggest worry as it was her first stay outside home in an unknown territory. We enjoyed every bit of our short stay. THANX GRAND HYATT!! We will definitely be back... :)
3928,manishjangid33,5,Excellent Place For Stay,"It is located well close to International Airport & Railway Station, I have stayed first time in Grand Hyatt and it was nice experience, The hotel is everything what you requires and the hotel staff is very good. They really cares for you.  i wish to stay again during my business visit very soon."
3929,424sunilm,5,ABOUT HOTEL GRAND HYATT,"Hotel Grand Hyatt is  luxurious and the comfortable hotel,  very nice atmosphere, good hospitality, great service manners,  but   we are Indians  this  type  of all Hotels  are avoiding our  manners and tasty   in  Food,  they  are totally devoted  for   foreign  culture.  This  is little  hearted to me. because i need the spicy foods  but   that is not available at   this  type  of hotels.     Hotel Grand Hyatt  staff is  very great,  they  are very cool and devoted for their work,  specially  i attracted by  Mr. Vincent  he is  very nice, cool and charming  boy  he  is  at working at  grand club.

3930,Ikson M,5,Keep Meetings....!!,As a travel Manager we keep organising Various events with grand Hyatt Mumbai and its an experience to deal with the staff there. they are absolutely on their best services. the Banquet space is amazing and the rooms are also nice. The chef Gopal is great has some amazing preparations and so is the entire sales team. kudos to the team there...
3931,ADEL00,4,"Grand, as it is supposed to be","It is big hotel, spread horizontally rather than vertically, probably due to its proximity to the airport.   Room was large with a touch of class. Washroom is unusually designed with two entrances and an integrated wardrobe. While it looks good in design, it compromises on functionality a bit."
3932,Graham P,4,Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"Grand Hyatt Mumbai is well located close to International Airport and approximately 30 minute drive to the Mumbai Financial District. The Grand Hyatt includes multiple restaurants to cater for all tastes. Friendly staff, very clean and a great place to stay."
3933,Isichak,5,I like this hotel very much,"I'v been staying in this hotel during my trips to India for the past year and a half. This hotel is everything you want, very nice friendly attentive staff, clean spacious room, great breakfast, great spa, lots of restaurants and even a shopping mall. These people take their hospitality very serious and will take care of any problem that might occure immediately. I have stayed in most of the five star hotels in Mumbai and can safely say that this hotel is one of the best. Keep going"
3934,pankajjo,4,class,The hotel continues to pleasantly surprise me with each visit. the staff seem to get better every time. Great place to stay for business visits as well as for relaxation. The breakfast is supreme and the evening buffet dinner delicious
3935,Lovetottravel89,5,Just excellent. Couldn't fault them. World class.,I am now a lover of the grand Hyatt chain. Service is world class and everyone was so friendly/went out of their way to make our stay simply wonderful. I have never loved staying somewhere so much.   The breakfast is worth staying there for alone!
3936,ArunKoshyThomas,4,Staffs at front desk needs to improve,"I stayed here from jun 1 to jun 4 2015 as a part of my business meet. Rooms are very good and provided with all facilities. Well cleaned, maintained and you wont find any problems with the room. Break fast buffet is complimentary for guests and it was also good with large spread.   Service was also good except the front desk where I met 1-2 personnel who were not proactive and made us stay for a long time for check in and checkout.  Except for that, it was a pleasant stay."
3937,Trav3llingGal,5,Excellent service!,"The service from the staff was excellent! whether they were from the front desk, concierge, housekeeping, restaurants or the spa. The food at all the restaurants were better than average. Overall I had a very good experience. Stayed 19nights."
3938,Yegas,4,GOLD PASSPORT ROYALTY TREATMENT,"Regular Global  travellers have the tendency of joining many hospitality programmes along the way and certainly not all of them deliver as promised. My recent stay at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai , however, highlighted to me that when these programmes are well run and staff are trained to recognise a Loyalty card holder, whatever the level might be, then recognition should be given and gratitude expressed. My recent stay at this establishment early in June was greatly enhanced from check-in to check-out with numerous service delivery elements that  enhanced my stay greatly. Due to a delayed flight out of Jaipur my check in was at a rather unsociable hour but staff at the check-in counters were all smiles and my request for an up-grade to a Club Floor room was granted without any‚Ä¶"
3939,Robert H,5,Stayed in Club Level,"Great hotel and really nice staff, had no issues throughout the week. The Italian and Chinese restaurants were also fantastic, and the complimentary snacks and drinks after 6pm were also great. The wifi in the Club Level lounge wasn't very reliable though, this was a dissapointment but certain seats seemed to get good access."
3940,Incognito,3,Overpriced business hotel,"This is large hotel in the Kalina area about 15 minutes from the domestic airport.   The hotel has a huge capacity, with several dining options. The room service offering is limited and is unusually expensive. Basic food like Thai curry is missing from in room dining.   Unless you have a company paying bills which they do not really care about , then avoid staying here. You might manage a decent room rate but the extras will kill you.   I attended a few events in this hotel  and the buffet spread was average at best.   Wifi connection was unreliable and frequently disconnected all over the hotel.   The room size is just about OK, and their double bed which a size between queen and king, which was kind of disappointing.   Not sure if I would stay here again."
3941,MargiePink,5,Modern Art Hotel excellence,"This hotel was fabulous. Very comfortable room, great restaurants... the breakfasts are amazing, also Italian, Indian, Chinese. The spacious public areas have been used to display wonderful modern Indian art... it's like an art gallery.. just beautiful. The staff are a delight... very happy to accommodate our needs. The  only negative was that the water in the pool was like bath temperature. I was really expecting to be able to cool down but unfortunately... no! However, I cannot let this detract, as the rest of the hotel was magnificent."
3942,alkomala,5,a perfect stay for business traveller,"Just like another Grand Hyatt hotels around the world, this hotel is wonderful! I stayed for 2 nights, and I found that all of things in this hotel are just perfect. The room is superb, very clean, spacious, cozy, had everything I need, luxury bedding set and also bathroom...the breakfast is delicious with variety of foods and beverages from western, Asian, and of course Indian...very helpful and friendly staffs...eventhough the location is not in the city centre, but this hotel is connected with a small exclusive mall which has several nice restaurants and coffee shops. Surely, I'll be back for my next business trip in Mumbai :)"
3943,Mohi_Khater,4,Speical Stay,It was my first visit to Mumbai. The hotel is very suitable for business traveler.  The hotel is modern. Rooms as well with nice style. The hotel staff is very good at service and very helpful. There is some noise from the street.  Tried several restaurant and all was lovely experience. Free Wi-Fi everywhere.  One challenge about the hotel is about the check-in and check-out process. It takes long time until you get the rooms keys. They are trying to help and to be nice but I took me 45 min. to get the room even it was around 17:00. This needs improvement.
3944,Savio S,4,Mumbai staycation,We did a staycation a couple of weeks back and booked a club suite - on the club floor - Great experience - especially the cocktails and finger food every evening between 6-8pm. The outdoor pool was extremely hot though and there should be some cooling  treatment for the water during summer
3945,Simon W,4,Everything a business traveller would need.,"From the hotel car pick up at the airport through to checking in at the hotel, I found the service to be excellent. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms well appointed providing excellent WIFI access. The main restaurant provides a broad range of food and is a convenient and suitable option for a business lunch meeting. The hotel is only 15 minutes from the airport."
3946,Pranamita,5,Excellent service!,"Though the Grand Hyatt is primarily suited for business travel, we stayed there as a family a few days ago and had a very pleasant stay. The facilities like the pool and the gym are very good. The room was well appointed - but I would suggest that shower stalls need to be installed in the bathrooms to avoid the after shower mess every time. Our best experience was interacting with the hotel staff - they are courteous and helpful."
3947,Sunilkir,5,Excellent Value for Money,We got a great deal on this hotel. It was conveniently located (for our purpose) close to the International Airport. An excellent all round choice. All except for the architecture of the bathrooms which seemed a bit off with multiple sliding doors.
3948,MaheshRajan2015,3,Good as a Business Hotel,"I stayed at Grand Hyatt Mumbai for 2 nights recently (29-31 May 2015) on business.  The rooms are pretty spacious and well done. Remember that the WC don't have a health faucet so some guests need to adapt accordingly.  Restaurants are good but somewhere I feel they are over priced, even compared to 5 star standards. There are lot of options for breakfast which is good.  Business center team is excellent (Mr.Ciril in particular), was of good help and courteous.  The interior of the hotel is well done, and maintained very well. However the outside (exteriors) are terrible and needs a lot of attention. A 5-star hotel cannot have a shabby look from outside, whatever be the reason as that doesn't give a good impression. This can be looked into."
3949,Sidh_rc,3,Grand Hyatt @Mumbai seems to have lost its charm,"I stayed in Grand Hyatt Hotel in Santacruz, Mumbai for 3 nights. Overall it was OK but the rooms, residential floor seems to have worn out and maintenance could be better. The lobby is nice as usual, with staff courteous and helpful. The carpets for example seemed to have worn out and the room is expected to be cleaner. The food in the restaurants was good and have enough varieties."
3950,Explorer4444,5,Great for business,"A well located hotel in Santacruz, this grand Hyatt is super convenient for access to the Sealink should you have meetings in churchgate.  The hotel had quite a few restaurants offering Chinese, indian or international cuisine.  If you have time then check out the night club in the hotel basement, but be careful as its super pricey! - Go after 11:30pm"
3951,FastTreck,5,Best 5 Star Hotel in peaceful place,"We enjoy our small family trip in Grand Hyatt, Mumbai. Nice and Clean Rooms, best facilities, Large hotel view, and gr8 staff. Place is also very peaceful. We are happy with in-room facilities. Good Bathrooms, big LED, Fast Free Wifi, Nice view and lots more... = Lots of Fun :)"
3952,Sun H,3,"OK, but getting worse","I Stayed there for 4 nights in May.   The hotel is good, but the rooms are getting old. I had stayed there 6 years ago, and i remember it being perfect. This time i don't have the same opinion.   It's still obviously pretty good, but not at the same standard as you'd expect from the brand.  The bed was pathetic. The matress was half broken, and hurt my back. This is something unacceptable in a 5 star hotel. I complained bu they didn't do anything.  The shower also didn't work as it's suposed to.  There was free wifi, and it was pretty fast and reliable.  The food was ok, but too expensive for what it was.   In India there are 2 types of 5 stars : the real ones like Marriotts , Taj, etc... and the fake ones like Lalits, Tridents etc... This hotel was in the first category when i‚Ä¶"

3955,sachin v,5,Nice location & quite peaceful in a busy city!,"Take an exit off the western express (very near to the Mumbai airport), you find a nested property in Santa Cruz. This seems like a perfect location - With BKC hosting the business travellers & The linking road at 10 minutes distance with host of eateries & pubs. Well connected to major part of the cities - Lower parel ( 30 minutes), Andheri ( 15 minutes) you can zip through across corners. For the property, tucked amidst lush garden, water - wall, legendary restaurants, SPA & an under night club, this seems to be perfect for winding your day's work.  Nice spacious rooms, good food & great hospitality lives up to the Hyatt brand, perfectly recommended."
3956,bankim_ms,5,Par Excellence,"By far a superior hotel by any standards, from the fast check in to even faster check out.  The rooms are spacious with excellent bed linens &  Toiletteries,  They have thought of every possible thing that one might need during our stay. Tranquil & Peaceful. I would love to stay again at this hotel when i visit Mumbai again.  Extra bed provided though was a little less comfortable and the air conditioning in my room was not top notch as it should be in this class of hotel"
3957,Kaustav K,4,Top notch business hotel..,"One of the best business hotels in Mumbai, for sure. Very comfortable rooms. Good food, especially the Chinese. Perfect for business meetings. Proximity to the airport also give it an edge over other hotels, especially in the suburbs."

3960,paiJagdish,5,Great memories,"I just want to say that the Grand hotel is the best hotel in town in terms of art work, customer service and food. The restaurant staff were extremely friendly, food was delicious and room steward Ananta was great. I would highly recommend this hotel who are not only looking for a buisness trip but want to have relax and eat good food. I also loved the gym and the spa facility. Rooms are huge and public areas are spread out. I am surprised to read negative comments about this hotel. The Austrian Executive chef was all over the place making sure the food served is up to his high standards."
3961,A143,5,Excellent Business Stay,Had the pleasure to stay for two nights at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai. The hotel with its facilities are wide spread. Restaurant selections are great with their buffet dinners. Wonderful ambiance and location.
3962,Brian B,1,Below Expectation ~ Especially compared to Hyatt Standards,"I stayed here from 28 April till may 5 in 2 rooms with my family and i must say it was a very disappointing stay overall. i especially had challenges when every time i asked the porters for something. Once i spoke to the concierge and asked them for a small box and i was told ""No problem we can get u anytime, we have it ready with us"" so 1 day before i left  when i can back from my trip i asked the porter outside if i could have the box to pack my stuff the guys said "" I am sorry sir we don't have, u should tell us 2 days before then might be able to arrange""   as a result i traveled 30 km to a friends house to collect a box from him. when i came back I get a call int he room telling me they have a box "" TOO LITTLE TOO LATE"" especially not a 5 star hotel standard. last time i‚Ä¶"

The Hyatt and Amoma, through which I had booked the Room night have committed a blunt fraud. Even after taking my booking amount of my Credit Card, and giving me a official mail confirmation, The Hotel did not allot me the room. My money still lies with the Hotel nor they have arranged to refund. Utter careless attitude from the Grand Hyatt Mumbai         "
3965,Saumya20,5,La Bella,I have stayed in quite a few luxury hotels and this one tops the chart. It has the best rooms with perfect facilities. Extremely good restaurants for all types of cuisines.

3969,Glenn D,4,Grand and good value,"Had an amazing stay, rooms are spacious and clean. Good bath products. Discreet staff and good value for money. Only slight niggle during our stay would be the noise since we were on the 2nd floor and I assume there was an event in the banquets. However it did not spoil our stay and will be back. Next time may be the hyatt regency. "
3970,TheWorldofFred,5,Best hotel in town,I believe this is the best hotel in Mumbai. I stay there a number of times and never been disappointed. The rooms are comfortable staff is great and very helpful. One of the nicest fitness facility that I have been in India. The China House restaurant is a must. 
3971,ArchanaPS,5,China House,"We went with our sons. ..both of then are diehard fans of the pot stickers at China House. Well, they were not disappointed.  The delicate flavours of the food are worth the long drive from my house. The rice was delectable. Just perfect. As was everything else we ordered. My husband is the only non vegetarian in out family. But even his prawn dish was good. All in all, at 15000 rupees for a meal for 4, (only one alcoholic drink included) it was value for money."
3972,Roheen K,5,Best hotel in Mumbai...,It was one of the best experiences when I checked in at the hotel. The hotel staff is so kind and attentive that we loved to talk with them. Authentic Italian food in their restaurant  Celini and amazing buffet at Ffty five east. We ate omlet during the days time which way the best. The spa and the grand hyatt plaza shopping centre is very nice. The ambience in the hotel is the best and the best thing is no noise around you and so you get sound sleep.In all a treat to remember. We had been here for 1 night but I got a late check out the next day without any hassle. Mr.Jignesh at the reception is the best person for late check out timings. We had got a honeymoon setup in our room in which we got a cake and bouquet of flowers complimentary. The chocolates  were also given‚Ä¶
3973,Sohini_Sen,5,Amazing Place To Be,The Grand Hyatt is one of the best places to stay in Mumbai! They provide great service right from your entry in the hotel. The food is also great! You will get all the amenities you can expect in a hotel.
3974,vinodmathur,5,Excellent hotel,"Good location, excellent business hotel with world class facilities. Good place to have a business conference. The restaurants have a wide range of selections.

3976,shailesh12342015,1,No value for money,"I stayed at the hotel alongwith my family on May 2nd 2015. We had booked 2 rooms. The checkin experience was good but after that many things were quite messy and left a very bad taste on our overall experience. Certainly we did not expect this from the world famous brand. 1. We had put a special request to allocate both the rooms adjacent to each other. Whereas we had ours and our kids rooms allocated much farther from each other. 2. The walkway to rooms was quite stinky. 3. AC in the room was very cold and we tried increasing the temperature but it did not work. 4. Snack that we ordered (sandwitch etc.) was good, but was quite expensive. 5. We went to a multicuisine restaurant within the campus for our dinner and we had requested only vegetarian food. None of the preparations‚Ä¶"
3977,HARI N,5,HYATT ..ANOTHER AMAZING PROPERTY,"Ideally located , with number of restuarants, lot of working area for business meetings ,convineant business center and above all very friendly stafff makes an ideal place to stay. For shoppers there is even an in house shopping area and amazing bakery as well. Great place to stay !"
3978,Aditya Gupta,2,Hotel Review,"Grand Hyatt, Mumbai: Ordinary place, sub-standard staff all round. The most generous assessment of this 5 star hotel could be 4.5stars hardware, 3star software. Right from the airport pick up to check out - sub par experience. The person was missing at arrivals and I had to seek out someone and make calls before I could find him after wasting 10-15min. The car for the pick up was not really clean/fresh inside. The check in folks were less than trained, and went about their business in a somewhat clumsy manner. Then the lady asked me to ""wait"" as she had to give me a letter (welcome letter from the convention I was attending - first time I experienced 'waiting' to be welcomed!). The driving license I gave them for my photo ID was never returned to me. Accepted that I also missed‚Ä¶"
3979,RoadtrippingFoodie,4,Beyond 5 stars,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for two nights and we fell in love with Grand Hyatt. We booked Grand Club rooms which comes with airport transfers access to private lounge which offers complimentary breakfast and evening canapes with drinks.   Airport transfers: They send a person to assist us at airport and drivers are courtueous and friendly.   First impressions: As soon as you enter the property you are left with one word, ""GRAND!"". Shopping center in front, Celini on right and huge art figures across hotel easily catch eyeballs.   Location: It's located near the airport and hardly 10 minutes drive from airport. Nearest landmark is University of Mumbai incase auto-rickshaw or taxi driver don't know where hotel is located.   Staff: They have most amazing staff I've ever‚Ä¶"
3980,premaraja,5,Great value for money,Hotel is large for Mumbai standards with all good facilities. Good restaurants and fantastic breakfast spread. Close proximity to business and airports and easier access to the expressway. The art works are very unique and tastefully done
3981,KGB777,2,Too noisy,"The main advantage of staying here is the great selection of restaurants in the hotel itself. China House, Cellini and Fifty Five East are all pretty good. The downside is that the hotel is very noisy, especially from slamming doors. If you're unlucky enough to have neighbours who decide to have a party then don't expect much sleep. There's also a lot of noise from people walking down the corridor, and you get aircraft noise too. I stayed last night and didn't get much sleep at all."
3982,Drupad,4,A pleasant stay at Hyatt,"I stayed at Grand Hyatt for a night and the review is as under:  1. Entry: The valet was very efficient and they quickly took out all the luggage and parked the car. Quick and smooth. 2. Check-in: We had to wait for full 20 mins to be checked in as their system had not received my booking. I gave them my booking vouched which the reception executive confirmed with her higher authority and then we were handed over the keys. Overall disappointing. The check in should be faster. 3. The room was an average 5 star hotel room, Nothing to boast. Air conditioning was good, the bathroom door did not have a latch to lock it and its gets tricky if you have kids with you. The fruits and chocolates were great. 4. Their GYM is amazing. Fully stocked with 5-6 treadmills  and cross trainers.‚Ä¶"
3983,James D,4,"Elegant property, and amazing stay, despite a few glitches with Verandah Suite","I chose to stay in a Verandah Suite. We were greeted upon arrival at the hotel and whisked away to a separate check-in area where my parents were able to relax with a coffee while I took care of the paper-work. I was met by Jyoti and Mahesh who both maintained excellent interactions with us throughout our stay.  The property is well put-together, has beautiful art throughout, and has all the facilities you need to relax, as well as for business. The pool is very inviting, and the gym is well-equipped. Steam, sauna and hot tub are all facilities you must indulge while staying there as well!  The suite was very roomy and was enough to accommodate my parents and me, and most things were within impeccable working order. I have always been impressed by Hyatt globally as they do pay‚Ä¶"
3984,ashray70,4,Nice place to stay,"Stayed one night en route to Hyderabad. Nice rooms, well done up, great ambience, good decor. Bathrooms and toilets clean. Layout was good. The only thing that I found disturbing was that despite booking many days before and clearly mentioning about three pax being there for the night, the extra bed was brought in around 1 am. It was not there when we returned from our social function. I had to call and remind them a couple of times. Checkin also took very long but we had landed a bit early at 12 noon. Reception staff was helpful."
3985,kalki007,4,An excellent apartment and a zoo!,"I booked this hotel through a travel portal because it was cheap compared to other five stars in the city.  When we approached the hotel, the gatekeepers were impolite and were arguing over something.  At the front desk, situation was chaotic too.  All this changed when we were upgraded to an apartment with a bedroom, a living room and a kitchen facing the pool.  This was an excellent apartment.  There was a slight problem though.  I had asked for a non-smoking room and was allotted a smoking room.   In the evening though the entire lobby was filled with people because of a conference.  I have never seen so many people crowding the lobby in any hotel.  The crowd was so large that it was overflowing on the pavement and the road outside!  Night was comfortable.  WiFi was free and‚Ä¶"
3986,Atul Shukla,4,Comfortable Stay,Had booked this place for a day. Checked in early. They provided us with room in residence as it was ready due to our early check in. It was a long way to walk. Did not enjoy the actual feel. Heard about this place a lot but personally we did not enjoy the residences. Might be the hotel will be great but residence did not meet our expectations. Staff was good. They have a good courtesy & way of greetings. Hotel premises has a shopping arcade. So people staying here will need not travel out a lot. Hope to try the hotel rooms next visit & get a good relaxation. Overall a Very Good Place.
3987,Bharat_KolhapurIndia,4,"Comfortable Stay, Will visit again.","Great ambience. Courteous service. I was upgraded to free breakfast as agoda.com had not included breakfast in my package. The pre booking info does not give clear information on inclusions. In India, local bookings are always including breakfast for business places. Location is great. Weekend package great."
3988,M_S,5,Excellent service again.,I stayed at this hotel again in April 2015 and this was my 3rd or 4th continuous visit. I am very happy to say that this hotel is one of the best in Mumbai and the service is flawless every time. Hoping that it stays the same for years to come. Good work Grand Hyatt team :)  PS: Please relaunch China House (the club) as it has become too boring and empty.
3989,Justreeps,5,A typical 5 Star property in Mumbai,Stayed for 2 nights on a business conference. Had a pool facing room and 5 stars for that . Extremely slow room service with a request for towels taking upto 30 mins. Overall staff is well trained and good. Rooms are spacious and comfortable but the hotel is ageing fast.
3990,Shuchita412,5,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed here basically while transitting through mumbai. So it was a short stay for us. But the hotel is lovely, the atrium and lobby areas are just a fantastic place to hangout or have an informal meeting. We stayed in a suite room and it was exactly as one would expect in a five star.. :) we totally loved the bathroom as well, esp. The spa style bath tub and the rain shower. The service was as per premium hotel standards, esp. In the middle of the night we had to request maintenance staff for someone to break open the lock of our suitcase, and they were quite prompt to come over and do the needfull. Overall a fantastic option in mumbai, & in close proximity to the airport."
3991,SwissJustin,5,Best 5 star in Mumbai,"Love this hotel, been here loads of times. Great ambience, spa and gym excellent, service outstanding. We usually stay in a club room which gives us access to the club lounge - snacks are plentiful and delicious, one of the best club facilities I have experienced. Look forward to our next stay!"
3992,nwk,3,Worn and in need of refurbishment,"Not my first time but a long time since my last stay. Sadly things are not as good as I last remember. Rooms are significantly worn down, mosquitoes everywhere and I was shocked to see that the amenities (see caption of tea bag) were worn down and not bothered to be replaced. Service was alright though not as good as the Four Seasons which is in my books the best hotel in Mumbai. The only thing saving this review from a ""poor"" overall rating is the good breakfast spread and the excellent Chinese restaurant China House and their authentic roast duck. The gym was pretty decent as well."
3993,Abhay V,4,Grand Hyatt is Grand,Very good hotel and they upgraded me to a suite. Rooms are big spacious and comfortable.  Total value for money. Only hitch is that the hotel is far away from downtown and still well connected to the highway. Pizzas are really good in their Italian restaurant.
3994,PANKAJ A,5,Vacation stay,We were in Mumbai for Christmas last year and spent several days at the Grand Hyatt.  It was an enjoyable experience as always given my previous stay at the Residences.  We particularly enjoyed the lavish breakfast spread at 55 East and my daughter loved the pool.  The staff were very accomodating and we would love to return.
3995,Amritf,4,Good Experience,"We stayed there for 3 nights as part of our Mumbai trip. This was a leisure stay and hence we chose Hyatt since we wanted to have some peaceful time.  The hotel was under renovation and hence was not fully up and running. Perhaps it was the off season and hence we found it a bit less occupied  Otherwise the stay was nice, rooms we neat and the food was good.  Overall we had a very peaceful time as we had desired"
3996,stargazeypie,3,Disappointing,I stayed one night on my way home via Mumbai after a three week tour of India. I booked a Club Room because I like the extra facilities of the Club Floor. My internal flight was delayed so I didn't check on till 8.30pm. When I did I asked for a drink from The Club which serves cocktails till 8pm but was told it was shut and they couldn't serve me.  Then I was told the Italian restaurant was full it was only when I insisted that they gave me a table. When I went there it was half empty.  Breakfast was good in The Club Room and the service sharp so that helped.  A nasty stain on the floor carpet next to the bed I could have lived without.  I do wish I had of gone back to The Taj Mahal where I stayed when I arrived. Not worth the money.  
3997,NITIN27SHARMA,4,Grand Hyatt Mumbai,"The Hotel used to deliver consistent service which were very predictable & efficient. Happen to stay recently & terribly disappointed by drop in Standards. - Wrong room type allocated - Room service doesn't pick calls for almost 20 minutes. The Operator tries & after a while saying will call, forgets. - Room service says we busy with high occupancy. (Is it guests fault if you are understaffed) - Room service comes with half order. Forgets an item. - Icing on Cake - Front office lady calls to complain about loud music playing as found by Security Manager. On insisting to meet the said guy, another chap calls to say sorry we mistook your room no. with someone elses. - Staff has no courtesy on lobby floors chitchatting without acknowledging a guest. - Breakfast table - Seems‚Ä¶"
3998,sanjaip2015,3,Grand Hyatt Deposit policy,"Reading reviews i still see people complaining about the check in, the deposit, etc etc. The front desk staff have no clue whats going on in terms off why a deposit needs to be secured even though the stay was payed for in full???????? This is really  something management have to look at thats if it matters to them!"
3999,dustgo,1,Be careful of hygiene and billing,"The overall service from this hotel was the worst one I ever met in Hyatt. Reserved king but put me to queen. Went to 55 East Restaurant for buffet and found a few cockroach on the top of scallop. The chef just took the cockroach away and did nothing to the foods. After checking out, I chose to pay in India ruppee, but they still charged me dollars with poor conversion rate. Also, some frond desk person cheat me that they could not do foreign money change, but I did change there in different shift of frond desk. Wifi was spotty too."
4000,Wordsi,5,Beautiful Hotel With A Great Staff!,"Enjoyed my first visit so much on my way to Goa that I stayed again on my return trip. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. I arrived at the hotel at 4:30 am. I was unable to check in at that time without being charged for a full night; however, I was immediately checked in at the earliest check-in time of 8:00 am.  The room was very quiet and comfortable. Wifi worked well. This hotel has the BEST water pressure that I have ever experienced in my life! I never wanted to get out of the shower!   The food in the Chinese restaurant was very good. The only unfortunate part is that the pool is apparently under major renovation and very unsightly.  Upon my second visit, I requested a tour guide to show me around Mumbai as it was my only night there. I was accommodated‚Ä¶"
4001,Hirak K,4,"Good Experience, Good Location and a great one indeed","Stayed here during an event in April 2015. First I was confused between this one and Hyatt Regency. So one has to be careful that this is Grand Hyatt and not regency. Location is good, around 15-20 min drive from Domestic Airport. May be slightly more from International Airport. Service of the staff, their grooming and courtesy are all excellent. Walk to the room is bit of an issue. Elevators are at two end of corridors and it's almost 100-200 mtrs walk to some of the rooms. Room is decent, not very big, around 40% of the space might have been taken up by the washroom and basin area. The wardrobe is well located can be secluded for changing. But there is very limited hanging space in the wardrobe. There is hardly any power socket to use the in-room iron board. Rest all are‚Ä¶"
4002,Robin D,5,Grand Hyatt Mumbai is Wonderful,"My husband and I stayed in the Grand Hyatt Mumbai for several days. I can't say enough about the beautiful rooms and facilities, as well as the attentive staff.  The Hyatt is an immaculate, wonderfully maintained hotel, and their staff was friendly, attentive, and obviously motivated to make our stay as comfortable as possible.    We especially enjoyed the buffet breakfast each morning, where many of the cooks and waiters were more than willing to share their recommendations with us so that we could truly enjoy the many foods of India.  Without them I would have likely stuck to the things I knew, and I'm so glad they were willing to share their favorites with me.  In the evenings, we also very much enjoyed the Bar in the lobby, where Karthik and his staff were most attentive.   ‚Ä¶"
4003,Kashp,5,Perfect Hotel!,"Stayed here with family for 2 weeks - was a pleasure!  Service is fantastic - nothing was too much to ask for. They are very accommodating. All the staff are courteous and helpful.  Room - again was great. Clean and classy. Housekeeoing always made sure toiletries replenished and room was always good. Again I felt they often went out of their way with little touches.  Food - this hotel has amongst the best Chinese and Indian restaurants in Mumbai. We tried the Indian one and the food was excellent. Really good but pricey - though about what I was expecting from a restaurant in a place like this. Obviously can get much cheaper food outside, but overall it was worth it for a nice ""non street-food"" meal in a great atmosphere. Breakfast too was always great. So much choice that‚Ä¶"
4004,Atul786,4,"Lovely stay with hotel, food was really gud.",i was impressed with the hotel. Only the problem is with services...they are very slow in services. If you put a request then you have to wait for long to get and revert. But our 3 days conference was very good.
4005,Molly P,5,Lovely!,"We stayed four nights at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai in January 2015, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back! All the staff (especially the staff working in the breakfast area on the third floor) were lovely, there was a wide variety of really nice food, the pool was well-kept and beautiful, and our room was very nice. The hotel is pretty far from downtown Mumbai and the Queen's Necklace, but we had hired a driver while in Mumbai, so we were able to get around to visit family and do some sight-seeing without problems. There were only two drawbacks we could find - the lobby was full of mosquitos and the wifi was really spotty. But overall, we had an amazing visit!"
4006,Hardik J,2,Disappoint all the way...!!!,"1) Checked in on April 3, 2015 and checked out on April 5, 2015. Still have not got my money back which they took as security deposit at the time of check in; even after calling them 'N' number of times. Please note, the amount was supposed to be refunded in 48 hours.  2) Nobody helps you with your bags and helps you to reach to your room when you check in. Almost all the staff members will direct you wrongly whenever you seek help.  3) I asked for a room facing central courtyard. I was handed a room which was facing central courtyard where the renovation work was going on. I surely did not ask to see how they do the construction work, and expect the hotel staff to understand the same.  4) I opted for non-smoking room which was fine, but I wish I could have non-smoking lobby.‚Ä¶"
4007,Mary H,5,Extremely conscientious and responsive staff.,"I recently made a booking here for the president of our company who was in Mumbai on business.  He had a very comfortable stay, but what sets this property apart is the conscientious and responsive staff.  He was only in Mumbai for one night and then had to depart to Delhi for more business meetings.  Upon arriving at his hotel in Delhi very late the next night, he had the dreaded realization of items left behind in his room at the Grand Hyatt in Mumbai.  I immediately contacted the hotel, and the items were quickly retrieved and arrangements made to have the items returned to his home in the U.S.  My many thanks to Sunita, Guest Coordinator, and the entire housekeeping staff at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai for going above and beyond to assist with the retrieval and return of these‚Ä¶"
4008,Rajiv C,4,Good As Usual,"It has been some time since I was there. Good place. They have maintained the standards. Sadly, they do not have an ala-carte menu at lunch. Sad The Chinese restaurant seems to have improved. Amazing food. Good gym. Close to the airport. Close to Bandra Kudos"
4009,traveller4,4,Great place to stay.,Rooms are good. Internet service is fast. Breakfast has lot of varities and also prepare as per requirement. Good Restaurants in the hotel. Value for money. Location is just little bit awakward but not bad.
4010,MananGarg,3,Not so grand in class after all.,"We stayed here for three nights. At the time of check-in I was charged (they said blocked, but I am still waiting for the amount to be reverted in my credit card) 15K as a security money, in case I decide to use stuff and not pay and run and hide (that was really classless guys). Other hotels, where I have stayed are happy to reserve the card details and charge on it if anything is used. That was not I was expecting from a five star hotel and how the guests are treated. Every morning, someone would specially knock on the door to count the missing items from the mini bar and fridge (other hotels usually do this with the room service or at the time of checkout). Other than that room was comfortable and service (apart from acting cheap and classless) was good. I am not sure if all‚Ä¶"
4011,Vivek Sharma,2,Something seems to have gone wrong,"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Wednesday night and can say that I had some weird experiences, something not expected of this hotel. Here is what happened: 1. Checked in at 12 in the night, had to leave at 6 in the morning and hence wanted to move to my room ASAP. However, there was some issue with the person checking in next to me and I had to wait for a good 15 minutes in the queue. Finally I became restless and asked the front-desk staff on whether I should switch my queue. He finally said, ""Sir, it will take time."" All this while, him and the rest of the staff had been meekly watching me waiting in the queue without suggesting me to move to another queue 2. I asked for a smoking room and they did not have any, but gave me a non-smoking room with a balcony and asked me to use‚Ä¶"
4012,Charles K,5,Very comfy,"Attentive staff, comfy and quiet rooms, excellent catering. From check in to leaving we were well looked after throughout.  The pool and gym are clean and well appointed. The restaurant caters for western and Asian tastes. We were on a business trip, the conference facilities were more than adequate."
4013,LoveDeepSnow,4,A good place with a high standard,Traveling in India is always very exciting. And it can be tiring as well. Getting some rest in a high class hotel can feel great!  We stayed in the Hyatt for 2 nights on a business trip and appreciated a very good service. Everything was clean and working. The staff was kind and very helpful. WLAN was working reliably and it was for free.  Why don't I give 5 stars? Because the place is a little bit to big. Everything is huge and I like it a little more personal. This hotel is made to cover large mass of people in a high standard.

4015,RAJIVBHALLA,1,Deteriorating  service standards and stay experience--not sure feedback even matters,"Been a regular guest at the Grand Hyatt , Mumbai. Have seen standards drop consistently over the past year or so. Right from a poor Check in experience to sensitivity to customer preferences to the overall service standards---all seem to be on a consistent decline.  My current stay experience had a room which did not have a replenished mini bar or any stationary (standard fixtures in a 5 start hotel). These were not replenished even after repeated requests over 2 days. Internet connectivity was abysmal. Despite having provided feedback for an earlier stay ---i see no improvement. Back to Taj and Oberois going forward---at least they know what Customer service and orientation is !!"
4016,ReenaSB,4,Very comfy beds/rooms,"My stay was pleasant as I valued a good nights sleep after a long flight and plenty of sightseeing. The luxuries of high quality amenities was appreciated after being in the days hustle and bustle in Mumbai. The only downside was that some of the staff were slow to respond, as it took 45 mins for my breakfast to arrive, only to find out 40 mins later that the order had been cancelled...they weren't very apologetic either. On the whole, great for getting that all important sleep!"

4020,giovannasolari,5,Everything you expect from Hyatt,Although we're all still battling various ailments from Goa this hotel is a lovely place to stay in bed for 3 days.  Our bedroom and the girls bedroom is a generous size and the living room is very comfortable.  I think the staff are aware and weary of my previously bad review of the Park hyatt Goa but the experience is what i've come to expect from this chain.  The lounge is lovely and the staff are very helpful (i should mention Francis who has been great with my little girls).  All in all an easy option.

4023,Darren T,5,"Great, relaxing and safe.",First time in Pune and was pleasantly surprised with the city. The hotel was even better.  Rooms are small but all modern facilities. Good TV and WIFI services.  Bathroom has a nice powerful shower and aircon worked a treat.  Food was good. Lots of good options. Western and Indian. The staff were exceptional and I made a point of speaking with the hotel manager to comment how great they were. This included the front of house staff in reception and restaurant and also security guards.  Gym was great and quiet and was next to a fantastic pool which was nice and quiet.   Shopping mall and Hard Rock cafe were both 10 minutes by taxi.  I was only here for 5 nights but I would certainly return here again if back in Pune.
4024,arvid59,4,Excellent service,"Stayed for three nights on a business trip. The hotel is located very close to the International airport and offers transport back and forth to the airport. The room was quite big and clean. Great selection for breakfast. Wifi was very good. Airconditioning worked very well. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The hotel has a very nice and large gym with plenty of equipment, and is open 24 hours. The hotel provided us with transport in good quality vehicles and safe and relaiable drivers, which is a must for Mumbai traffic. The buffet restaurant at lower level is pretty good."

Although during the booking through their website, our flight details were taken we didn't have a vehicle when we landed in Mumbai. We were explained by their airport staff (yes they do have two people from the hotel assisting their guests at the airport) that either someone from the hotel should have called us or we should have specifically requested for a pickup. Anyway within 10 minutes the vehicle reached us. Please make sure whoever needs a pick up should mention the same. This hotel is located very close to the airport.  The hotel is huge and does not look very grand from outside. However we were pleasantly surprised once inside. It is a beautiful property. The Club rooms have a separate check-in‚Ä¶"

A buffet breakfast in one bar was followed by more food for the second innings in one of the restaurants (Both with TV screens). A very reasonable all-inclusive price for food and drink made it a great day out. The food was of a high quality and the service was spot-on with very attentive waiters and polite staff.

The hotel is huge, but architecturally very mediocre. Even the interiors are not impressive. The room I had was spacious but the shower was very unusual outside the bathtub, but not a separate unit.  The front desk staff was helpful, but the F&B need some serious training. My experience at the Chinese restaurant was very average. I would say that the good food was let down by indifferent service. The restaurants manager listened to my concerns with an indifferent expression on his face. My food experience in the next day's business presentation in their banquets was terrible.

The 55 East restaurant has amazing mouth watering dishes, and excellent advice from the people in charge ..

The lobby is large and can be a bit busy but there are places where you can spend some quite time with your music or work. The rooms are not very spacious but this is downtown Mumbai and space is at premium. The d√©cor is soothing and the staff very courteous.

Work done, emails sent and went to bed.The next morning, I hit the gym and that is when my nightmares began. Upon returning to the room, I realised that the bottle of water that I was consuming the night before had brown sediments floating in it. Almost heavy sediments that settled at the bottom and which would turn the water completely brown if the bottle was shaken. I felt sick! Rang the reception. In typical Indian style, many rushed to the room, out of curiosity for the most part. No decision makers bothered to come. After some noise, some supervisor turned up and upon learning‚Ä¶"

I noticed this morning that the rate available had gone down to 11700 IDR. Now based on the exchange today that only adds up to about $30 USD. Certainly not gonna break the bank. The problem occurred at check in. I asked for the slightly lower rate, which BTW included breakfast too. So perhaps the difference was closer to $50 USD. At any rate the clerk would not lower my rate explaining that the rate I booked was the rate I will be charged.  A little surprising since rates fluctuate and any quality hotel would honor the going rate that has been published today on their website. So ok its only $50 bucks but not great service if you ask me. Room was adequate but small. Air conditioning‚Ä¶"

Yesterday when you checked me in and said that you had upgraded me to the Apartment I had joked that I am only here 6 hours and won't get to enjoy the Apartment and will trouble you to upgrade me next time to which you had replied that you will try. I had never stayed in your suites before and so was excited to stay in one. But upon entering the room everything was amiss. Being so late in the night and me having a early morning flight I did not change the room. I feel since you did not have a grand suite available when I checked in last night so have decided to downgrade me. The room was not plush and neither anything about the bedding.

There is an appearance of tight security, with hand baggage and pocket items going through a scanner.  However I've only observed male guests being search following entry through the metal detector.  Obviously not forgetting vehicle checks at the front gate.  The reception / check in area has a 5-star feel to it.  My luggage was taken from me even before I knew which room I was going to be in and quickly arrived to me once I was in my room.

Secondly, its definitely grand in every sense with a wide range of restaurants, spa , gym, swimming pool etc. The rooms are also large with all the luxury possible. But the problem started at the very beginning. The check in time is 2 pm and as there were a lot of check ins in that particular day as there was a big conference going on (which I was also a part of), our rooms were not ready even after 3. Moreover, the person in the check in counter was not giving any clear reason for the delay and appeared quite casual and borderline rude.

4065,ManmeetBhamra,5,Always Amazing and yet another 7 star experience,I have visited the property for most of my short vacations when I wish to spend time with my wife during weekends and we last visited in May 2014.  I had booked a room on a special offer of Hyatt at a discounted 10th anniversary celebration and could not do any amendment on the rate and to my surprise the hotel upgraded my room for free without charging me anything to a grand suite room.  I have always got the best experience whenever I have stayed at the property and would recommend it to everyone as the property defines the quality of Hyatt Brand in Mumbai
4066,Debgiri,1,GRAND HYATT MUMBAI IS THE WORST,"The worst Grand Hyatt I have ever seen. Very unprofessional staff, rude people, bad eating places and uncultured service desk.

Traffic tip for Lower Parel (relevant for Mumbai in general I guess) - leave before 8:15! If going to Nariman point, leave by 7:30, or even better - stay in south Mumbai instead! :) - Wifi can be dodgy in certain rooms - but the IT service team strive to fix it once you let them know (they placed a modem in my room once).

4071,MithileshMIC,4,Best in class customer service,My overall experience with the hotel was good. Often they say reservation is non refundable and can't be cancelled. They should change this attitude. However i got the required amendment and email responses were good compared to interacting on phone.  The facilities are good and service is also best. Best hotel for business meetings as it is very close to the airport. I would recommend people to opt for Club room as there are many complementary facilities Hotel provide in club room which will cost you a lot if you go for Standard room.

Rating to this hotel because it was not worth paying 30k per night   Stayed during NILF 2015 and the event was very good foods are ok breakfast ok rooms very cozy and no space   Overall average hotel. Checkin took 3hr for them to allocate rooms.  Room amenities was very limited . Bathroom was having very odd design.

The rooms are nice and comfortable, room service is excellent,breakfast has a lavish spread, overall service is very good and the property is located very close to the domestic and international airport. The wifi works excellent and the gym and swimming pools are very well maintained. As a Hyatt Platinum member, I highly recommend this property for business and family trips."
4078,Manabesh Hota,4,A Star Hotel close to BKC,"I stay as a corporate customer. It's a 5 star hotel very close to BKC. So if you have work at BKC or a multiple location at both North and South Mumbai , then it's a good location to stay to reduce travel time. The buffet is just grand and service is world class. It's also a very good property to have your conferences and get-together.  Just be careful about the road to take or you might get stuck in Mumbai traffic."

You will go 'WOW' as you climb the stairs to the large lobby area that open into many restaurants and a shopping area at the end. It's simply HUGE and very elegantly designed with a contemporary touch. Very well trsined staff who are really good at what they do, HYATT always gives you the best service,  no doubt about that.  They have a very interesting choice of restaurants and a good wine bar. They also have a superb Chinese restaurant that seems very famous amongst the Mumbaikars,  and a night club that was filled with all the good looking people of Mumbai.

I stayed here for 8 days and I have to say my first impression was that this hotel is amazing and i am going to have the best time here. Im sure if i stayed here for 3 days i would have found this place perfect. However i didnt.   what i hated about this place, is how rude some of the staff are and i have been lied to twice in this hotel: 1st time there was a chubby hostess in the west restraurant downstairs and i asked her i want to sit at a certain table because it was closer and she told me someone is sitting there but the whole time i can see no one sat there until i left. she seated me at the furthest table in the restaurant I do not know if its a‚Ä¶"

Will visit again. "
4086,Casebas,5,Top class hotel near airport,"Very nice, well managed hotel near the airport. Restaurants are also high end with multiple options such as Chinese, Indian and Italian. Fitness center is top notch and the staff very pleasant. Only real complaint is the noise in the hotel room, in particular from aircraft, cars honking and early morning calls to prayer. But definitely stay here if you need to be near the airport!"
4087,kussh m,3,Comfortable Rooms,Check in was quick though there are times when you need to wait in a queue and could take upto 15 minutes or so for check out. ..Rooms are comfortable and spacious...but the breakfast is boring..and the service is not upto the level.Had to remind the staff for the masala dosa I ordered which took 20 minutes.

4090,NitinPurandare,4,Good place to stay,"Been staying in this hotel for few years now during Mumbai visits. A nice property with elegant rooms, decent staff and reasonably good service.   Only problem we crew faced last time was some stomach upsets though we could not pinpoint to a food item. Doctor service provided by hotel was good but unreasonably expensive!  Will not mind staying again here though. "
4091,Dhritiman B,5,Great hotel,"Within a short distance from airport, this hotel is located near the office complex of Bandra Kurla. Very convenient to approach. The staff is very helpful and exudes warmth the moment one walks into the lobby. The rooms are very comfortable. Service at restaurant is great!"
4092,amit k,5,Great Experience,Rooms and service are excellent. Restaurant is extremely busy in the morning with all the business travelers. The only letdown is a poor selection of shops which is not in line with what is generally expected at such premium properties.

But they should come with some alternative ."
4094,Henry64Chelsea,5,Excellent airport access,I spent a night here in early February and then went back again for two more nights later in the month. The hotel is ten minutes from the international airport so it is not as close as some hotels but I really prefer the Grand Hyatt over the Leela. I stayed at the Leela two years ago and I think the Grand Hyatt is much better.   The staff went out of their way to assist. Atika and her team at reception were especially helpful including the concierge desk.   On my first visit I stayed in a room overlooking the airport with planes coming in. There was some minor noise but it was not a problem. The room window glass is extremely thick On my second visit I had a room again on the fifth floor facing west towards downtown Mumbai. On both visits the rooms were immaculate. Everything‚Ä¶
4095,Simon W,4,Quick & Comfortable Stay for Business,"Apart from being allocated a Queen Bed room (instead of the booked King Bed room) - which was eventually resolved, (albeit late at night on my arrival), the Service was very good as usual and the facilities and staff excellent.  The restaurants at the hotel also provide excellent service and food - particularly the buffet breakfast and lunch served in the Fifty Five East restaurant.   Of note, WIFI access is now complimentary.  I look forward to staying again and recommend the hotel both for the business and leisure traveller."

I especially want to commend the great Coffee Shop crew who handled a very busy weekend (huge conference at the hotel) with aplomb.    The location is good if you like to be near the airport or want to explore the northern part of the huge city, getting to the southern tip of town, passed marina drive to the colonial area of the ""Gateway to India"" takes a good while, but then everything in that congested city does, depending when you travel, and taking a taxi is necessary almost no matter where you are staying.

The check in was smooth, the rooms were fantastic, the decor truly fine art, the staff always ready to help - I was blown away by the service and the ambience at the hotel.  As I was there for an indian wedding, the ballroom was large and beautifully decorated - an experience of a lifetime!   Outside the hotel is where the hustle and bustle is, but when you are in the hotel surroundings, you feel like you are in another world of bliss and calm - very relaxing :)  The shops in the hotel had very nice indian fabric and souvenirs which I took advantage of - quality!

There is a feeling of spacious feel about the hotel. Their club rooms are very well appointed and come with an airport pickup and drop. Their club lounge is a great place for meetings during day.

I was part of the NASSCOM India Leadership conference, which was held at the hotel.   Upon entering the room, I found that there was unused tissue paper in the commode. The housekeeping guys had obviously not done a good job. In addition to this, housekeeping kept wanting to come into the room after check in to fill in the mini bar. I struggle to think of any five star hotel which has this kind of service - that to when you pay well over 10,000 rupees a night.  The next day, I wanted to iron my shirt and found that the iron in the room was not working. I called housekeeping and asked for a working iron which they sent with a housekeeping boy. The second iron sent was also not working. At this point, I had‚Ä¶"
4102,convie,4,Overall good but Internet and plates!,Stayed for 4 nights and this was my 5th stay here. Overall a good hotel. Close to the airport but nothing much to do around the hotel. Check-in and check-out was a breeze.  Room was good. Well-kept with all amenities. The breakfast spread was excellent and food at the Fifty Five East was good.  Just two things to crib about.   The newsletter in the room clearly states that all Hyatt hotels worldwide will provide free Internet from February 2015. But not implemented in this hotel.   What is with the plates in Fifty Five East? Any particular reason why they are so small. I found this very strange.  Will be back next year and hopefully will have free internet and bigger plates!

4104,PGHG,2,Is it really a Hyatt!!??,"I am a regular at Hyatt, having stayed in multiple location. Normally, I like Hyatt hotels. But boy, was this different!!  The ordeal started right from the time I got down on the porch. I have a back issue. Indian security requirements are to scan all incoming baggage. No porter, and the belt is high up. So, bags need to be lifted up and collected back.  That done, I make my way to the reception. Reception is on the first floor, and there is no ramp. So with a the bad back you lift the bags and climb up. There is indeed a lift but for that you need to walk ~100 meters to the other end of the hotel and then walk back to the reception.  Anyway, I reach there; and guess what my booking in the name of a wrong 'Pramod Gupta'. When I question why, the gentleman says don't worry. Its‚Ä¶"
4105,prasad_bhandary,5,best in class,I stayed here in mid of January and found this hotel to be truely living up to hyat standards. The place is closer to business hub bandra kurla complex and adjacent to express highway which makes it convenient for setting up client meetings..

But the follow was excellent even the duty manager enquired about it never got my refund for the Internet on the days it dint work, but I forgot about it too, next was room service on one of the evenings delayed, took 70 minutes , food was cold, seems like the order was prepared and left to wait for the delivery or someone totally forgot about it.

Has a small shopping arcade attached to it with the usual range of shops for souvenirs."

4109,Batwon,5,Great Top Standards,"Top Hotel, although there was a lot of mosquitos in the lobby we had a swift check in. Also i had to put a no post in my room as i had Euro's for the authorization yet you change it to rupee's and give it back in rupee's when i  leave and that doesnt make any sense to me. I dont want to change euro's that i am not gonna spend with a bad rate and i dont wanna take 30000 rupees back home when i leave so you gotta revise that as you also lose revenue as people with a no post on their room cannot spend as freely. Other than this, room is luxurious and amenities that was given was incredible. 2 different sized pairs of slippers, flashlight, shoehorn, 6 tea bags and around 4-6 waters replaced everyday. (you dont see this in many hotels). Water pressure in the shower is awesome. good‚Ä¶"
4110,FacelessBureaucrat,5,Perhaps just a little too attentive...,"The hotel was just as good as it has been on past stays, and the benefits of the Club floors, with the free continental breakfast and evening reception (food and snacks included) make it well worth the surprisingly reasonable room rate.  If anything, the staff are a mite too attentive, although the service they give is generally excellent. Reception could be a little bit more focussed in the main lobby - so many staff yet they don't always appear to be doing much.  The gym and spa are very good, the restaurants varied and high quality, and the location, excellent for North Mumbai and the airport, perfect for me at least.  I'll certainly stay there again..."

Food is great,  I like the indian restaurant best. But the buffet restaurant is a great alternative to Indian food. The rooms are well appointed I upgraded this trip and had a suite which was if anything to big for my needs but very nice.  Breakfast has a wide and varied choice and with 4 restaurants you are spoilt for choice. The hotel is close to the airport and the new link road makes it even quicker. All in all a great place to stay in Mumbai."
4112,jaymatz88,4,Conference,Stayed here for one night on Feb 7th/8th. Front office was very professional. Excellent room; food quality was wonderful. Bathroom & toilet was also well maintained.  Mainly attended a conference. Auditorium was good. only problem was that the area where lunch was served was very congested (outdoors!).
4113,greylacquerpearl,4,usually stay here every time,"The grand hyatt has become my second home. I am in India often for work. When traveling so often one needs certain comforts like good food, good gym and pleasing aesthetic. The food at the hotel is excellent. I love the chinese restaurant here. The Italian food also very good. The chef Alessandro is so warm and friendly and has really brought an authentic touch to the restaurant. The pizza is excellent. They have great breakfasts also in the morning. My other favorite detail of the hotel is the gym and swimming pool. The gym is very clean and modern and spacious and has top of the line equipment. They also have a nice jacuzzi area downstairs to relax in the spa after a hard day. This is inside so no worried of mosquitos! The rooms  are very clean and modern and comfortable. I‚Ä¶"
4114,SudiptoDas99,4,Good for business travel,Stayed for a night last month. Very close to the airport and luxurious.Great spread in the breakfast.The only problem was the long waiting time for checking in.Overall a pleasant stay for one night and recommended if you are on business trip.
4115,krishnachytanya,4,Good for business,"Good hotel, Nice interior. Good for business travel. Request to management is that don't call many times in morning (for mini bar check etc) while guest is still in room. Better take this when you clean the room. Food is good. Breakfast is OK. Nothing to complain about. Cleanliness can be improved. I see a lot of dust on decoration artifacts in room."
4116,NayanShaila,3,Hotel with Grand Mosquito problem,"My wife & I stayed at Grand Hyatt for 3 nights.Our stay was completely marred by mosquito problem.We complained about the inherent mosquito problem throughout the hotel. We were given several excuses,one of which was that it was winter in Mumbai and the mosquito problem is prevailant in whole of Mumbai! They did not address this issue. I have read a review by a contributor on 12th March 2013 who had a similar problem. And Guests had the same problem in 2012. So Grand Hyatt Management is fully aware of it.I expect to get a standard reply'We engage most prevalent pest control company in order to assist us in combating this exernal environmental issue' Same reply from management in 2012,2013,2014!!! Do not fall for it. Even our room had mosquitoes. We have stayed at several 5star‚Ä¶"
4117,SA1977,3,Food is not even 1 star,"Forget 5 star, the food in this hotel is nothing more than 1 star. Had a buffet lunch today at this hotel and I was feeling guilty of bringing my guests here. In vegetarian food, they had only 2 vegetables and 1 Dal (lentils) to offer. They had a wide variety of deserts, though. Looks more of a sweet shop then a restaurant. Buffet lunch was charged at Rs 2300/ per person, which was on a very higher side considering what they had to offer."
4118,RAJESHKAMAT,5,Cool 5 star near the domestic airport,Stayed here last month for 3 nights on Business trip.Would recommend the Hotel to anyone who wants near to domestic airport (10 mnts drive).  Stay was in excellent room with kingsize bed with inner hotel view and absolutely no disturbance.Lobby is huge with good access to all parts of the hotel.  Breakfast was superb with too much of varieties with stress on south indian.Even the room service was excellent.

4120,Harsh H,2,Detoriating by the day..,"I have been staying at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai for several years now and must say the hotel has detoriated and needs a serious face lift!! The facade of the hotel visible from the rooms is crumbling and has become an eyesore. Even the rooms have not been maintained to the Hyatt standard.  My last stay was a series of blunders by the hotel. Having booked a balcony suit, they checked me into a two bedroom apartment style suite. Since it was just two of us the two bedrooms was of no use to us !! Secondly, the carpets were so dirty, yucks!! The suite needs major mantainence !!  On checkout another blunder. Having booked through the hyatt.com website had got a rate of approx INR 16,000/- plus taxes, but they charged me around INR 22,000 + taxes. After a lengthy discussion and a 15‚Ä¶"
4121,Stianhj,5,A good 5 star hotel,"This hotel I would recommend to everyone. The food at the hotel was absolutely fantastic. The rooms were large and nice, good standard. Reception staff were very nice, and a remarkably good service. Only 6 km to the airport (domestic) Should you stay here then I strongly recommend eating on 50 five east."
4122,Crazykiran,5,Luxury Is the name for this hotel!!!,"I recently visited this hotel on my corporate travel and stayed in this hotel for couple of nights... This hotel is a big huge luxurious hotel with superb services. The hotel lobby is humungous and so elegant. The food is very nice and to compliment it the service is even better. The staff in the hotel is very caring and efficient. The girls in the lobby to welcome are very professional and also very helpful. The check in was very quick and efficient and so was the billing on the day of our check out, very smooth. It seems that the staff is very well trained and knows how to handle guest in such a demanding and competitive market like Mumbai where there are so many options to stay. Rooms are big and modern and looks very elegant.   Overall a very comfortable stay though it was‚Ä¶"
4123,GargiC2013,5,Fabulous...,"Stayed for 2 nights as part of business trip - I must stay its an excellent hotel in Mumbai, not only in terms of location (near to airport & good access to other parts of city) but also in terms of warmth & hospitality. A very big hotel, the rooms are very spacious and very well designed and the one i stayed had good views of the pool. Food was excellent to say the least - we ordered in-room services and found the Chinese delicacies absolutely lip-smacking and breakfast spread too many to choose from :) All in all, a lovely experience and highly recommended for family & biz travellers."
4124,Chantal N,5,If there were 6 stars I would have given you 6!,"From the Hotel entrance, to the Lobby, to the huge rooms, to the great service and excellent food and dinning areas.  This hotel has got to be the best I've ever visited.  We had a tiny issue were we plugged in our hairdryer and the lights tripped, without missing a beat we were moved into a suite with its own lounge, patio over looking the city and a complimentary platter of food for our ""trouble""  Loved everything about this hotel!"
4125,cashish11,5,Grand it is,"Imposing lobby, big rooms, huge gym and wonderful hospitality and large breakfast spread.,, couldn't have asked for anything else from this hotel. This is one of the few hotels, where they provide bath salts instead of usual bubble bath thing for the bath tub and leave a box of chocolates in the room that is not a part of mini bar (not sure if that chocolate had anything do with my Hyatt diamond status). Would have loved to stay here longer, had they offered me a long term rate."
4126,abidmoosa,5,One of the BEst 5 star hotels in Mumbai,I had visited the grand hyatt last may stayed for 2 nights.. It was a fabulous experince.. Hospitality at its best... The hotel has almost everything inside .. world class ammenties... If you are not too worried about the centralised location and only priority is airport then i would suggest this is the best hotel in mumbai...The staff very co-operative .. The breakfast buffet was Awersome... Had a very comfortable stay and experince over all.
4127,kalebjohn,3,Ok stay but noise from Banquets is too disturbing,We stayed in Grand Hyatt Mumbai and found our stay as ok except for the fact that noise from Banquets is too disturbing specially in the lobby area. The hotel takes big banquets because of which even the parking gets jammed otherwise our rooms & food were ok although service needs improvement.
4128,HSJ,5,Comfortable  stay near domestic airport,"It‚Äôs a nice 5 star hotel located very near (10 mins. ) to domestic airport. A business hotel with comfortable rooms, good restaurants and a wide spread continental buffet breakfast with lot of Indian choices. In room wifi is available on extra charge."
4129,tookatah,3,Missed the mark as a business hotel,"The Grand Hyatt is a big, modern hotel with some nice design features, but overall was disappointed in my recent business travel experience. The hotel was hosting a large event on the day I arrived, and I got the impression that it's probably better suited as a party venue than a business hotel. For example, despite having pre advised my arrival time, the room type I booked wasn't available (I'm also a loyalty scheme member so this was even more frustrating.) I was moved to an apartment, but this wasn't really a good alternative - the room lacked hotel amenities like a robe and a hairdryer.  I also got a pretty poor night's sleep after being woken up at 4am by some very loud 'party' music - I noticed that the event was being hosted in the central outdoor atrium area, which a lot‚Ä¶"
4130,Ira D,4,Fantastic!,"Great Option near the Domestic Airport. Grand Porperty but well managed and maintained. Some great restaurant choices. Excellent service. Lobby area is busy but once you are in your room, its very peaceful and quiet. Rooms a well maintained and large. Would recommend. specially if travelling with a family. Close to Bandra West, Airport and well connected to worli side too.location is very central."
4131,Ibosio,4,Good place to stay in Mumbai,"if you want to get a good hotel close to the International airport. Building and the structure are very modern and clean. Depends on the rooms, but in principal is decently quite which is a luxury in Mumbai considering the acoustic pollution you have.  Rooms are well furnished and clean. Good amenities. You can have 2 good restaurants: Italian and Chinese food in a nice environment. I have been visiting India a lot for the last 7 years and I should say the level of the staff is definitively high in terms of service. All depends on what you are looking for. For sure it does not deliver the 'charm' of a Taj or the Imperial hotel in Delhi, but...it is for sure an hotel positioning itself in the high range."
4132,AbhayKanodia1,4,Awesome Hospitality,"Friendly staff and good service. The atmosphere in the hotel was good, bed was cozy and comfortable.   Service was quick and food was really nice. Breakfast was complimentary and had a varied variety it was difficult to even cover it in 3 days of stay."
4133,ArizonaLangs,4,So much better than the Hyatt Regency,"Stay here, if you're debating between the two. It's pretty far from the airport by comparison (an extra 15 min, maybe), but service is better, hotel is better kept, rooms were nicer, and the breakfast was simply incredible, even though horribly busy.   The only problem we found is that from the drop off area to the elevators/check in desk, there are stairs, and we could not find an elevator for my dad, who is slightly handicapped (recovering from knee surgery). So... where is the wheelchair access?   I can't speak to airport transfer, as we had that arranged separately. I also don't know what dinner is like at the hotel because we went out into the world for that part of our stay. This was a short stop, so we didn't do any sightseeing at this point in our trip, so also can't‚Ä¶"
4134,Geri M,3,a lot of expense for uneven quality,"This is a somewhat western-style business/quasi luxury hotel;  It is at least 15 min. from airport due to location on ring road; not near anything that can be strolled to.  Bottom line:  would stay there again if a travel emergency required; to really see Mumbai flexibly, better to get down into town.  JW Marriott at Juhu better.  Pluses:  excellent health club and spa.  Very quiet and dark room (at least on apartment side where I stayed).  Pleasant staff.  Club level has very nice breakfast and early evening snacks so so somewhat mitigates restaurant issues.  Minuses:   Food in this hotel, other than club level, is a total rip off -- structured so that the default cost is about $25 USD.  Open air restaurant grills mean entire hotel smells like cooking and smoke much of the‚Ä¶"
4135,ravimark1,4,Good Hotel,We stayed at this hotel for one night and I must say that it was one of the good stays I have had for a long time. Why I have rated it only 4 star and not 5 is just for one reason and that is the not very friendly/ helpful staff and a noticeable differential treatment of guests. I would prefer that every hotel staff treat each and every guest in the same manner. Check in was quick but check out took a long time. Since this is a busy hotel one needs to keep this in mind while checking out and have a little extra time in hand.  The hotel is located close to the airport and that was a plus point however it is a bit isolated and it is difficult to get transport except the ones arranged by the hotel or the taxis that the hotel staff call from you. Both are expensive as they charge‚Ä¶

Nevertheless, my overall experience was good and I would stay in this hotel again."
4138,eric s,4,Very Good,Nice hotel. Close to Airport. Room size ok. Not too big.  Couldn't find any inclusive breakfast deal/option on the hotel's website but my travel agent could manage that.  Coming to breakfast.. On both days had to wait 15-20 minutes in queue for a breakfast table. plenty options and really good taste.  No facility for Driver's stay nor the hotel staff was aware of any nearby budget lodge. Frankly we also could not find one. to add to that they don't allow drivers to remain in basement car park. So the situation turns tricky.  Overall good option.
4139,travellingcellist,4,Very comfortable,"I really liked my room here. Comfy bed with immaculate linens. Lots of amenities in the bathroom. I think they get the record for most complimentary bottles of water ever found in a room: 12 bottles!!  Room furnished to an excellent standard. It's a shame I only had one night here. Swimming pool area is lovely although the water was a little too cold to fancy swimming. Nice sunbeds for lounging around at least though. The gym looked great too. Breakfast was a decent selection, although I wasn't overly impressed with food hygiene. The fresh fruit should have been served with the utensils that sat next to the bowls, but the staff instead wore gloves and picked up the fruit by hand....fine until you see them doing 100 other things wearing the same gloves before they serve your‚Ä¶"

We stayed 3 night in a suite and found the hotel to be excellent.  It is a very large hotel, but the the service is exceptional.  Everyone seemed to know our name and all our needs were taken care of.  The room was large, comfortable and to a high standard.  The buffet breakfast that was included was excellent with food options from around the globe.  The coffee was also GREAT!  We dined in both the Japanese and the Chinese restaurants in the hotel and they were excellent too.  It is a great choice if you are in Mumbai."

Nice property with very efficient front office. However would have been nice for some Guest relations person to escort till room to avoid small problem I faced of room key opening...Apparently a simple solution would be to clearly mention instructions on Key Card itself. Very conveniently located with short distance from good pubs nearby in Bandra. The In room dining food quality needs some attention. The Breakfast buffet is the best among most 5 star Hotels in Mumbai with great variety & courteous F&B staff. Hyatt however needs to provide free Club hours to regular clients. Also always wish hotels itself has a good happening pub to have a great evening. Probably that's‚Ä¶

As in the past the service is outstanding and hotel amenities are top notch (although it comes at a price). The day I left there was a congress of reumatologists and everything was chaos. Congresses should be moved out of the common guest areas. I even heard screaming and fighting in the check in desks. Enojed bar and personnel extraordinarily. Breakfast is very good although the cooks are a bit distant in their tasks. Smoking rooms available"

However, a stay here is a great experience.  The rooms and common areas are kept immaculately clean. The gym has a plethora of equipment for cardio and resistance, laid out in a spacious setting - this is an area worth highlighting: no matter how many people were in the common areas, the hotel never felt crowded; yet, one never feels overwhelmed by large spaces and high ceilings.

Not bad wired internet but very unstable Wi-Fi access which is actually a wide problem in India. Good workout facilities. No place to visit by walk nearby. I'd say there has been no specific problem while staying here for two months at the end of the year 2014.

They made a mistake with my room reservation on the second stay and although the communication between staff was not at its best (in passing messages to the next shift which resulted in it taking the best part of a whole day to resolve it!) they were very apologetic and each time I spoke to them they tried their best.

We booked a package that included breakfast, and the breakfast was absolutely wonderful. There was a wide variety of foods available on the buffet to cater to different tastes.  The only downfall of staying at this hotel was that the hotel is not located close by to places which we could eat at, but the hotel did have a few restaurants. I found these to be quite expensive  Traveling from this hotel was easy, we were always able to find a taxi outside the hotel. Although none of these taxis were metered taxis.

Pleasing nature & ever-ready to help, moreover he has a good understanding of hotel facilities and is able to anticipate a need.   Among the concierge I would single-out Sibi.   Restaurants are top class, I will single-out China House.  Will be happy to come back."

Rooms were good sized about 300 sq ft and the bathroom organization one of the best I have seen. Bathroom was well stocked with all kind of toiletries and the shower experience was rich.

The girl looking after us upgraded us to an executive suite which was very roomy and comfortable. This place has maintained it high level of service and always strives to keep the property in prestine condition and well manicured however this time around they were doing some exterior maintenance which resulted in the covering of the interior windows.

A couple of days prior to our arrival we were offered Executive club at a very good price. This I would recommend highly as Wi-Fi was free, as was a wonderful breakfast, a two hour cocktail buffet with delicious food (hot and cold) as much to drink as you like and a lovely room to enjoy these treats. There are complimentary soft drinks available all day and a constant stream of nibbles. The actual hotel itself is a joy. The staff could not be nicer or more helpful, the facilities are brilliant, a great Spa area - almost always empty, great sauna and stream, a lovely pool, amazing selection of restaurants, and the room was fantastic. A huge recommendation! "

The quality of the food at the restaurants makes it worth eating in rather than searching for a restaurant in the nearby village.
4169,Alpesh-5,5,A hotel that doesn't say NO,Stayed for 5 nts at this hotel. The staff didn't say no to anything I requested. Eg They even offered to serve me blast when I came in 30mins after closing time. The politeness and courtesy they should us humbled me. Well done to the entire mang. 
4170,Ms2914,1,Disappointing and discriminate against people arriving on an auto-rickshaw,"We arrived late in the evening via an auto-rickshaw, which was not allowed to enter the hotel entrance. As a result we had to carry our bags and child that was sleeping to the main entrance. When complaining, we were given a lousy excuse that the entrance is too steep for auto-rickshaws, which is surprising as auto-rickshaws travel all over Mumbai and go on steep bridges. If you want to travel around Mumbai on auto-rickshaws think twice before booking this hotel because their policy will not allow you to be dropped off at the hotel entrance. In my opinion, the hotel has a status issue, which I have not experienced any where else."
4171,Michellemebelle,4,Great Hotel,"we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The room was very clean with a very comfortable bed. The location was pretty good with a great local night market and lots of shops selling beautiful fabrics and sarees.  Room has everything you need, even a large flat screen tv but we tend to watch to much tv at home so couldn't advise on the quality of channels. Be careful with the mini bar as the drinks are very expensive... We treated ourselves to room service and the service really quick with tasty food and great  value for money. Would stay again and recommend this hotel."
4172,ChetanA786,4,"Amazing lunch with my family,,,","Being Christmas, had to take my wife and kid out for a nice lunch. After a bit of research online decided  to go at this place called Cellini at grand Hyatt which is known to be the king of Italian food and guess what it lives upto the title. Since it was my 1st time , the manager Mr. Dharshan made sure that we felt comfortable and suggested the best food along with Tira misu as desert which was tooo good. Though this place is expensive but it's worth the money and experience."
4173,Luke,5,One of India ' s great hotels,"Stayed here for 3 nights on the Monsoon rate special of about $90 a night. Stunning room and facilities,  very competent and helpful staff and restaurants are to die for. The Xmas buffet was possibly the best meal I've ever eaten. Be careful though the costs are expensive as you get hit with a massive luxury tax at each turn."
4174,Shridar J,4,standards are slipping,"i was torn between a 5 star  and 4 star rating - i am going with 4 because the standards here are really slipping.  stayed here maybe 10 times in the past 9 years - a mix of work and pleasure.  food here is still great, rooms are still good and the gym is more than adequate.  however the service standards are clearly slipping across the board.  my check-in process at 11:30pm at night took me 2 rooms and 45 minutes to get to a decent nights' room, that despite me having alleged privileged Hyatt ""gold passport"" platinum status (not that this status was acknowledged).  even me giving my feedback to the hotel directly resulted only in a bland generic email saying they'd try better (like, whatever, try replying personally to the feedback instead of punching out a vanilla cookie‚Ä¶"
4175,rmarkar,3,Not worth the money. Its just pathetic...,"We came to relax & revive ourselves from a stressfull environment from 19 to 21 Dec 2014, but have only left with a humiliating & bitter experience (THAT TO PAID ONE) of a so called 5 star hotel which ruined our holidays.  Services offered by the hotel did not meet the expectations of a 5 star hotel. Room services were good.  The staff keeps revolving near the entry area for tip, i believe.  If you enter the hotel with a luxurious car, the staff will be helpful with your luggage,  else with an ordinary car the staff is judgemental and not at all helpful.  Atleast 15 to 20 staff people are present at the entry, but if you enter with an ordinary car,  the staff though not occupied will not help you (I am not saying this  because this only happened to me but during these 2 days I‚Ä¶"
4176,KAPOOR-rajeev,4,Good Stay,"nice place, in the city, neat and clean, not souch expensive to stay ir dine. One should have experience ti stay here. Just a bit delay in room service. But very polite staff and very comfort stay zone."
4177,Faiz1901,4,Consistent!,"I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt on business multiple times and every single time the service is consistent and of high standard. This is my second review as i have stayed there quite a few times in 2014 and they have never dissapointed.   The only thing i expect is that there is a little more special treatment to regular guests in the form of room upgrades. every hotel i have stayed in regularly remembers you and upgrades you once in a while except Grand Hyatt, While this is not a deal breaker, i wouldn't be lying if is say i expect it!  As for the hotel , the location works for me as its very close to the domestic airport and you can cover the distance in less than 20 minutes in non peak hours.  The rooms are fairly large and well appointed.   For me the best part of staying‚Ä¶"
4178,Anton L,5,At the top of the list,Stayed twice in 2014 both times on business. Rooms are of a perfect size. Facilities are on top. Breakfast envily good for the competitors of the same level: all type of the cuisines and very balanced choices. Service is unquestionable. The only problem might be location as the trafic around is a killer but where in Mumbai it is not? Overall highest rating. Highly recommended. Again: book beforehand and you can negotiate a very good deal.
4179,tripme52,5,Would return here any day.,The front desk staff here are friendly and efficient. The concierge arranged to have a tailor come to the hotel to make sari blouses for us. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. We upgraded to the club floor which was excellent. Great choice of cocktails and canap√©s and again the staff were attentive. If I have any criticism it is that  the breakfast buffet could be improved. I did not like the way the food was set out and it is very busy. But really overall I'd love to go back.
4180,rajatbehal2006,5,Grand experience!,"Stayed at the hotel for one night last month (Nov'14). The hotel lives up to its name and is truly GRAND in the look and feel. Starting from the Hugh lobby, reception desks, artwork, stone statues  etc. the word is just Grand. It is so near to the airport, so it really helps in case you are transiting. I visited for a big conference which was very well organised and helped by the hotel staff.  The rooms are big with walk in bathroom. The room is well placed with all utilities available in the room with almost no need to call for service, even though there is a personal touch and a small note from the service staff who has taken care to make up your room prior to your stay.  The breakfast spread is well thought with a lot of choice available as in all 5-star properties.  All in‚Ä¶"
4181,Mistry26,5,Excellent Hotel!!,"The hotel had brilliant security measures giving us a sense of security staying at the hotel. The hotel itself cannot be faulted the staff were lovely, The rooms were a nice big size and were very clean.  It was easy to be able to find transport to get around Mumbai. Would love to stay here again on my next visit"
4182,BhawaniPathania,4,"Justifies it's Name, Grand..!!","Yup. That's what they do. The name stands justified, as the property is Grand. Hardly a few minutes from the domestic airport, Grand Hyatt offers a luxury 5 star experience to the customers at not so 5 star prices.  The hotel is also a destination for lot of conferences. We had one here a few days back. The banquet area is massive. Service is good and the quality of food really decent.   Coming to the rooms. The rooms are large and most of them are quite well lit. The standard equipment is on offer. Minibar, bathing gowns, iron and the iron board, room slippers and other knick knacks are present. And I almost forgot the humble tea coffee kettle.    The bathrooms are luxurious, and include the bath tubs as well as the shower area.   Overall,  what's on offer is a true five star‚Ä¶"
4183,sanjaip2015,4,Excellent Hotel but very bad policies,"We recently stayed at this hotel and found to be very good, hotel reception area and rooms are all very neat and clean. The restaurants are expensive but the service and food quality very good. There are a few things that can improve the hotel standard further namely; 1. No free wifi ( other 5* hotels we stayed its free) 2. The hold they put on your card for a deposit, if the accommodation is paid for in full why must this be done?? Usually other hotels just swipe ur card but no transaction goes through but here the actual amount (20000 rupees) is put through your account and to get it refunded takes 7 days plus!!  Several guests had this issue at the hotel while we stayed there! This frustrates guests since the staff have no clue how to address the issue. "
4184,Wanderer539824,1,Passing through Mumbai for 1 Night,"I stayed one night as I was connecting from Mumbai to the next destination. Whereas the hotel has the potential to be great, the staff were a disappointment. I paid USD320 for the room for only a few hours stay in the hope of getting peace of mind before moving along the journey. Couldn't sleep a wink. It would have been better to sleep in the streets of Mumbai. Loud, disrespectful guests on the same floor, loud movement in the corridors and absolutely no peace until 1am - which is when I had to leave. As I checked out, the receptionist did not even ask how my stay was. To add insult to injury, my credit card was charged TWICE for the amount because they could not release the preauthorization. All in all, quite a disappointment for paying so much for so little. Definitely not‚Ä¶"
4185,CanisHan,5,All was excellent to me.,"C1 ( 2014.12.03 )  I stayed this hotel about 10 days for Mumbai and Aurangabad trip. This hotel's service, food, room and all was satisfied to me. Many staff was very kind, restaurant's food was excellent, roome was very comfortable. In inconvenient point, this hotel was near airport and far from in main city, and there was nothing to walk around near hotel. But the rest was all excellent in many aspect."
4186,Sahillucknow,5,Very Nice,I was visited here in Oct'14 for a business meeting. The service was really good with high security. The food quality and starter was awesome. You can eat anything and you will get a good test. Also the desert was really good
4187,kp4434,4,Nice Hotel,Hotel is near to Mumbai Airport 20 min drive. Rooms are good. Their food is excellent. Enjoyed the food. Staff is very friendly. They make all efforts to make you comfortable. Only one problem the internet speed is very poor. Overall nice hotel.
4188,Kanishk V,2,Not a very good experience this time > Food had Coconut shell and hair,"I planned to stay here and relax for a day before leaving for a very long flight. The good : Loved the pool and drinks served around there. The house keeping staff was excellent.   However on the day I arrived, I dint feel welcome at all, not even a Hello from any of the staff and front desk staff. I mentioned it to the front desk gentleman who was helping me check in. He reiterated what I said and then went quiet ?? He called his manager who was a pleasant lady. She tried apologizing and said she saw that I was a Hyatt member and was not used to this service.  Anyways, we checked into our room. I had asked for a hot water bag 2 days before checking in.  Had to remind them again and then it came in a while. I was expecting this in my room since Hyatt provides you an option of‚Ä¶"
4189,Jay C,4,Enjoy 5 Star at 4 Star Rates,"It has Good Deals In General. Nothing needs to be said about anything for the Hotel. Simply Outstanding in All Aspects. Very near to BKC. Check Out took bit time in my case during both of my stays. Also if u want to go out only Blue AC Taxis available, other Options are seldom available. Lots of Restaurants and Good Food."
4190,jccphd,3,"Great Atmosphere, But...","The Grand Hyatt is a very nice hotel. The interior atmosphere is contemporary. Staff are very attentive to every need. The breakfast buffet in particular is outstanding, and includes a wide variety of foods from several cultures. Rooms are well appointed and roomy. Bathrooms are very modern and also roomy. There are in-room safes. So what are the negatives? The hotel is essentially in its own compound relatively near the airport (a plus) but far timewise from the core downtown area (a negative). It is not easy to walk around in the neighborhood. Airport noise is a problem, especially around 2:00-3:00 a.m. Conversations in the hallway and in adjacent rooms are easily heard. The WiFi is unreliable (neither my nor my colleague's laptop were able to connect, only our iPads). I used‚Ä¶"
4191,AamirSayed,4,Best stay,Have stayed here couple of times ..and they very much ensured that i had the best of the time. I was specially overwhelmed when I first stayed on my birthday and the surprise package arranged was par excellent.  But this time during my stay in October I was bit disappointed with the upkeep of the room. The material on the chair was ripped off and curtains had stains. Nonetheless all this went unnoticed when I had scrumptious breakfast in the morning.
4192,Macadamia4444244,4,"Very beautiful hotel, a nice dining experience."," We went for evening brunch, it was quite value for money, you can have all you can eat and drink sangria/ beer too.    The food was very nice, but a bit ambient temperature, felt a little harassed by the thousands of chefs that were trying to be helpful, but distracted you from looking at the food.    The food was of a very good quality and the service was very good.   The downside was that the sangria was just wine with a bit of fruit in it, quite strong too. If you order a soft drink it is quite expensive, surely soft drinks are cheaper than all the booze we were drinking?! The beer is very frosty and delicious though.    The staff coulf do with offering a menu to show what extras you can ask for, as some of the guests had already been before, but I had not, so I was unaware‚Ä¶"
4193,sandeepmohangupta,5,Official Stay - 2 nights,"Great Hotel. Large, as its International counterpart in Dubai. Rooms are spacious. Breakfast spread huge. Dinner in buffet restaurant great. Italian restaurant is also good. Hotel has abstract art works across the entire hotel common areas. Staff is helpful and in general hotel is good. Gym is well equipped and nice.  One area for improvement - TV channels are very limited. Should look to provide entire bouquet of them.   Rooms are in general quiet however one can hear if people talk in the aisles outside the room. May be sound proofing in the room needs to improve."
4194,Bryan M,4,Nice but the wifi is lacking,"Good stay overall.  There was a problem with my room thermostat that was promptly fixed.   I would have rated this a 5 star except for the wifi in the room was poor. While this was tolerable years ago, top hotels today need to move beyond that and have good wifi everywhere. The standard excuses that your room location is bad or too many people using it are not acceptable anymore.  The lounge on the ground floor was a bit noisey with loud music that could faintly be heard through my walls. Colleagues traveling with me reported it much worse in their room."
4195,BarbaraJoubert,5,"Great location, amazing restaurants","This is for the biz traveler who needs access to good food options. Great exercise area, pool is clean and has good service. Rooms are typically well appointed for Hyatt. The surrounding area is not particularly attractive and there is no view. Watch for some construction noise."
4196,arvind_walia,5,Excellent hotel,Location is very close to the airport. Its just off western expressway close to Bandra and BKC. Rooms are big and very well maintained. Lobby is huge. Nice restaurants with some lovely ambience. I would surely recommend it to others.
4197,Jason G,5,Excellent hotel with great restaurants,Very high end hotel. Rooms are very nice.  And there are exceptional restaurants in the hotel.  The service was great and the overall feel if the hotel is safe and immaculate.  I wish I has stayed for more than one night.
4198,Jim S,4,Great place but noisy,"Had a great week at the Grand Hyatt but had 2 nights with poor sleep due to excessive noise from the nightclub. I stayed in the club rooms on the 2nd floor but had difficulty getting to sleep, partly due to jetlag but mostly because of the noise. Otherwise a great place with good restaurants and a good gym"
4199,DotcomTraveller,5,High class hotel,Great hotel in a convenient location for shopping in Santacruz and dining in Juhu. Its also very close to both the Domestic and International airports. The rooms are large and clean and all mod cons. the hotel has its own shapping mall with about 20 shops. the bar in the hotel is fab with a great choice of single malts and it does fantastic food (the starters are very filling).
4200,galliardo,4,Love this hotel but they slipped up this time,I picked this hotel and was looking forward to staying here again having visited last year. I would still go back but  wouldn't fall for the check in patter next time: Receptionist: Would you like a quiet room; me : 'yes please'; R : 'okay I'll put you away from the elevators'. What he didn't tell me was that there was road noise and a banging service door making far more disturbance that an elevator. And  would take the 'rip off' WIFI rate since the standard rate is SO slow and you pay for it. Hyatt should at least include the slow rate within the basic loyalty programme.
4201,ITACA CERAMIC I,5,Excellent Hotel For Comfortable Stay,"Hotel is the best for both business class, for family & vacation.Staff is very helpful & always smiling & ready to help you at any time of the day.  Best cleanliness. Breakfast mouth watering & delicious."

This was a last minute business trip and when my partner and I came out of the airport exhausted and very much looking forward to getting to the hotel, we discovered our greeter and transportation to our hotel was nowhere to be found. Further more, I discovered that I had no other information form my booking agency about where we where staying in Mumbai on my person, and my access to that information online was not available as the internet was not working on my devices. We were at a stand still outside of the airport with all our luggage with no way of finding out where we where staying in Mumbai. Luckily we ran into Mithil M. Guest Servies officer ‚Ä¶"

Food n atmosphere is good n healthy ..  
4204,DrRajneesh,4,So Efficient & busy that the Grand part gets lost,"It is a good, efficient hotel perfect for business trips. No delays, front desk to restaurants everything is efficient. It was so clinically efficient, that probably the Grand element got lost out.   The staff goes out of the way to make you comfortable.     It is a busy hotel so do not get caught in the rush. Morning buffet breakfast can be extremely crowded. Though the hotel will try accomodating you in the other restaurants at that time.   I thought there should be a free wifi - atleast in the lobby or maybe they can come up with a hot spot somewhere. Free wi fi was missed.  Enjoyed the stay. Please note that this is one hotel which is  really close to the airport and well within the city."
4205,M_S,4,Nice property. Good service.,Just stayed here last weekend and I am impressed. Very nice hotel and rooms. Good service. They should offer free wifi though. Highly recommended. The Mutton biryani from Soma is highly recommended and should be tried. The China House club is a huge walk away from the rooms and through a confusing route. This is the only downside.
4206,Cinesanky,3,CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT,The name speaks for itself.  Variety of restaurants and cuisine to chose from. Had food at a restaurant there called 55 east which was really nice. There is plenty of shopping too. Swimming pools of a decent size. Ask for a higher floor with a pool view. Bombay has too much traffic so higher you go lesser the noise. Remember you don't get a room with a road view. There is a flyover going to the airport so that blocks all your view.   Over all a nice property with plenty to move around.
4207,Shubhs10,5,Great hotel!,"The room was in great condition, our room was on 6th floor and had a swimming pool view, which was pretty awesome both in day and night! Will recommend it to fellow travellers as it had delicious in room dining food as well!! And other hotel facilities were also nice.  Actually we took there weekend package and so we therefore the hotel was a great value hotel."
4208,Abhishek K,5,Actually Grand (and good),"Let me be very honest to accept the fact that this review may look positively skewed (pardon me for that), primarily because I was generously upgraded from a standard room to a suite... was fairly decent and big and grand (as the name of the property). However, given all this, the property overall is a nice one, umpteen support staff to facilitate the whole process of hospitality.  Room are spacious with all required amenities. Only thing that I felt as a lacuna was the absence of complimentary wifi (charges otherwise were relatively high, however I understand that a complimentary wired connection was available).  Room service is almost flawless. Food (in room dining as well as the buffet b'fast) is good (in terms of taste), and fine (in terms of spread).  The only room for‚Ä¶"

I wanted to get to the hotel Friday evening and relax before a 12 hour tour the following day. Unfortunately at about 9.30pm a function that was on the ground floor start playing very loud music. I called to complain at about 11pm and I was told it would last for maybe another 15/20 minutes but the music carried on until Midnight. I appreciate that hotels also hold events but the music levels were just too high, the water on my bedside table was shaking with the base. And then after the party finished two men had a huge argument right outside my room for about 20 minutes (The walls are very thin and you can hear everything in the hallway and adjoining rooms).

4210,soubaner,4,A Pleasant Short Trip,"I recently visited Grand Hyatt Mumbai for a short stop prior to my onward journey to London. Their airport transfer is pretty seamless with option of Toyota Camry or BMW 7 series.  The hotel oozes 5 star class with crystal clean interiors, passage, lobby and hallways. Check-in is fast and you get to your room in no time whatsoever.  A nice variety of room service menu but if I found it pretty much irritating having to explain it to them why I have ordered more food. You expect a bit of privacy provided if you are a Hyatt Platinum member very close to being Diamond.  Anyway, in the next visit, I hope to explore the hotel in depth and write an updated review."
4211,ian1968_10,5,Great Place but out of the way,I have travelled from the U.S. to India several times and if I am in Mumbai I always stay at this hotel. It is a great place for an American to hang out. Super comfortable beds and excellent service. The spa is also nice and reasonable prices for a back rub or another treatment. This is a premium hotel with premium pricing and amenities.   I thought the food was good at the hotel. The breakfast has plenty of selections to choose from. I typically eat lunch at work so I can't speak to that. Dinner was 5 star but nothing to write home to mom about.   The location is a bit out of the way. It is on a freeway but it may take time to get around. If your interest is in the downtown area this could take awhile. If you are a first timer to India you always have to understand that it‚Ä¶

The bad  During check in procedure limited explanation of diamond member benefit.  Had to ask. And some others I found out by accident.  Pealing external facial. Desperate in need of paint job.

4215,contactiyengar,4,Grand Experience,I had the opportunity of staying in Grand Hyatt Mumbai. Excellent experience. A good spacious room with bath tub and varieties of bathing soaps.  The only feedback is that it is noisy sometimes and guests can hear other doors being opened and closed and house keeping activities happening in other rooms.  Breakfast is excellent.  Overall value for money and a royal experience.
4216,RenaA,4,Loved our stay,"Beautiful hotel, loved the rooms.  The buffet restaurant was amazing!!!  Amit was  just wonderful organizing the taxi drivers to get us where we needed to go and he and his colleagues always had a smile.  The only small issues we had were that check in took so long and we arrived at 5 p.m.so didnt expect that and they messed up on breakfast for our friends who had an early departure."

To South Mumbai where all the sites are such as Prince of Wales Museum, Taj Mahal Palace hotel and the famous gateway to India takes about 1-1.5 hours drive, this because traffic is quite chaotic in Mumbai. Around hotel there is very little but the hotel does offers alot of facilities such as shopping mall, salons and so there is not much need to leave the hotel for say a walk.  Room  Room was a suite on the 4th floor, it offered a living room, large bathroom, bed room and balcony. The bed room offered a queen sized bed- very comfortable soft with warm bedding.

4219,kazza1buchanan,5,comfortable stay,"I have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Grand Hyatt.  It was really great.  Its in a very central location, but it is a quiet haven away from the noise of the city.  It is close to the airport but easy to get into the center of Mumbai.  All staff I dealt with were very pleasant and always wanted to help.  Rooms very comfortable and large suplied with drinking water and tis was always replaiced.  Pool area was fantastic always got a sunbed and supplied with drinking water both gymn and spa area also really good if you have time to use them.  Good shopping mall within the hotel. Restaurants were good especially the buffet down stairs an amazing choice of food mainly cooked there for you.   Would definately return to this hotel on my next trip be it business or pleasure."

There is a high end mall at the hotel and china kitchen is excellent restaurant which turns into a club post 11 ..
4221,B M,5,Business Stop in Mumbai,"I stopped by Mumbai for two days of business and can say that this is truly a great hotel.  While it is common for hotels to have nice lobbies and then cut corners on the guest rooms, the Grand Hyatt is an exception.  My room was tastefully decorated with a modern look and used lovely wood and stone throughout the room. Also, I counted no less than 6 bottles of water in my room which was a nice touch.  As mentioned by others there are plenty of choices for restaurants, but I just ate at the little coffee bar area between the reception and shopping plaza. The food there was quite good and as I was traveling alone I did not need an elaborate meal as is offered at the other hotel restaurants. Also, there is a nice shopping area that has some rather high end products as well as some‚Ä¶"

4224,Rhishi T,5,Tops,"At a short distance from the airports tucked away from the traffic the hotel is top class in terms of space, ambience, service, food and is truely a class in its own. The staff work quietly but efficiently and are very courteous. The breakfast has numerous options.  The reception staff is efficient. Mind you it gets quiet crowded if a conference  is happening in the halls at the basement."
4225,JGN1970,4,Great stay,We choose this hotel for distance to airport and Bandra which us an area we like. If we had more than 2 nights we would have stayed further south but for 2 nights and the dreadful Mumbai traffic we opted for the Grand Hyatt. We booked the club floor which is well worth it for the usual benefits of evening drinks and canap√©s as well as breakfast. The pool is lovely the gym is fantastic as is the spa. We booth had massage which was nothing special. The hotel is huge with large choice of restaurants for those who don't want to ' get out' so it is a tad corporate but great irrespective of this.

4226,Mathaison,4,Great hotel,Back to the hotel after a long time. Service still top notch. Love the service. Its a large property so going to their restaurants can be a bit of a walk. Also some of the restaurants seem to be block booked so you could be turned away if you do not have reservations. Can be pricey after all the taxes thrown in.   The room faced inwards to the internal courtyard & I could see the tiles peeling off the walls across the property. Makes me wonder why maintenance was allowed to deteriorate.   Evenings can get very hectic with the social crowds visiting so getting in & out of the entrance can end up being a jostle. This is also compounded by the security check in place which pushes all guests & hotel residents via 1 route. Can be a melee during a busy night.   The wedding halls are‚Ä¶
4227,biggee77,4,As usual a good place to call home when in Mumbai,This is around our 5th time at this hotel. We always book the club as it's well worth it especially if you enjoy a glass of wine or 2. They upgraded us to a suite this time which was really nice. My only issue is that on the second night the club lounge was crazy busy. There were not enough places for everyone so much so people had to sit at the check in desks outside. We will be back again in December for another relaxing weekend.
4228,rachelannmorris,5,Always a Great Experience - Mumbai's Best,"This is my third visit to this great hotel and each trip gets better. We were a group of six (five rooms) and everything was handled flawlessly by the staff.  From the reservation through to organizing tours for our big group, booking cars, dinner reservations and the lovely touches of chocolates and flowers in my room (and my friends) it was just terrific. Even check out at 2am was a breeze thanks to the attentive and well organized staff.  Special mention must go to Arun in the front office, the concierge team and the staff in the Grand Club. They made this visit memorable for all the right reasons."
4229,TheCornerChair,4,"A good business hotel, conveniently located","Grand Hyatt is a good hotel in all ways for a business trip, nothing to complain about. The location close to the airport, BKC and Kalina makes the commute easier too.  The rooms are well equipped and spacious. Food is excellent... the breakfast is good in terms of both taste and spread. Dinner buffet is great too.   Overall, one of the better places to stay while on business in Mumbai."
4230,aloha_original,4,"friendly hotel, best place to stay in Mumbai","good buffet breakfast, especially interesting to sample the Indian dishes.  friendly staffs.  good gym.  pool is not really an exercise pool but more like a family fun and family friendly pool.  it's an old establishment but well maintained so it doesn't feel old at all."
4231,SmritiBajajGupta,4,The hotel is more like a business stay,The hotel is situated in BKC in Mumbai and it is not like other Grand Hyatt properties. I would more rate it good for business come leisure trips.  The buffet spread for brunch is amazing. It is little steep but it includes drinks and if you planning on spending sometime their it is a very good option.  The rooms are decently sized.

Our event concluded post midnight and we had to take some collateral which we had brought for the event... Unfortunately one of my colleagues left with the original challan due to which certain formalities had to be completed... Another colleague of mine completed the formalities and Mr. Sankpal assisted him dutifully.

4235,Zubinhio,5,Best Business Hotel in Mumbai,"A hotel packed with convention facilities, I suggest the hotel mainly for business activities. One of the biggest ballrooms you shall find in a hotel in Mumbai and backed up with further more conference rooms, also due to its location near the airport, I recommend this Hotel for any business activity. I wouldn't really recommend this hotel if your purpose of stay is leisure. Their specialty restaurants Celini, Soma and China House are fabulous but expensive. You can also try out Fifty Five East."
4236,Chaitanya_Khaitan,4,A good property but Arrogant Staff,"The property is Located in Santacruz East. There is nothing really close by to this place, that is why it is a massive property with decent sized rooms for a city like Mumbai.  We were a family of 8 and stayed in early October. The check in process was terribly slow. The staff at the front desk had ‚Äúcare a damn‚Äù attitude. We waited for over an hour to get the rooms keys. The rooms were very spacious and modern. It is a huge property and every floor has many rooms so make sure to make a request before hand if you have booked multiple rooms. Rooms have street view and pool view.   Breakfast spread was good and quality of food appreciable. We had a totally different experience on the first day of our stay. Their breakfast ends at 10:30 am. Sharp at 10:30 am the breakfast was closed‚Ä¶"

We stayed at the honeymoon suite, this room was just amazing. The interiors were all done up really well. The best part of this suite was the  bathroom also it was very spacious.  There was good privacy , no one disturbs you in this hotel for stupid reasons.   The room service is very nice and quick. We enjoyed some yummy pizzas here.  I'm eagerly waiting for my next visit to this hotel !  Must go for sure !!"

We stayed for 72 hours that is 3 days for preparation of long haul flight.  As we have been to India many times and know India well,and after fabulous 4 weeks tripping around Italy,we found this place to be such a oasis we didn't leave it at all during our 72 hours.

4242,nitinchatur,4,Great Weekend @ Grand Hyatt,It was a weekend after Deewali and we planned a trip to Mumbai from Pune. While planning the accommodation we came to know the weekend offer from Grand Hyatt Mumbai. In this offer one can stay for 2 nights while paying only for one night. Its a great deal and I must say Grand Hyatt Mumbai is very conveniently located for a leisure traveler in Mumbai.  Our stay at the Grand Hyatt was very enjoyable. The only thing to remember is that in the weekend offer does not include a complementary breakfast. This I thought was a bit of a dampener.
4243,Wayne G,4,Lovely Business Hotel,"Stayed here three days while in Mumbai on business.  Hotel is located fairly close to the airport and offers all the comforts one expects from the Grand Hyatt.  Rooms are somewhat on the small wide, but extremely comfortable.  The hotel restaurants are simply outstanding, you would not find better anywhere.  Room service is quick and again an exhaustive brilliant menu.  Staff are polite, efficient and always willing to go the extra mile.  Facilities are first rate and accessibility is equally good. Internet is slow and a paid for service.  While I do not mind paying for internet access, I do expect it to be fast - it is this alone that lead me to rate this hotel 4/5 and not 5/5."
4244,Sayantani Chatterjee,3,Not very satisfied,"1. Location wise this property was good (closed to airport, Bandra etc) 2. The buffet spread of the restaurant 55 East is fantastic (both during lunch and dinner) 3. During my trip, there was dry day till 6 PM due to Maharashtra election. Without any information they closed the mini bar. And they didn't open it after 6 PM after several reminders. 4. I was surprised to see that they removed the half-filled cookie jar and locked the non-alcoholic beverage also 5. I ordered some snacks at The Bar, which was over-salty; however, they replaced it once informed 6. However, the behavior of the staffs are courteous. They helped us find good restaurants and pubs in Mumbai for fine dining and hang out Overall I have an average experience with Grand Hyatt Mumbai"
4245,Lalita08,5,Absolutely fantastic! Best hotel service in India for me so far!,"Upon arrival I was surprised to see how big and grand the hotel actually is! Greeted by smiley, friendly staff which continued through our stay for 4 days. Staff have been very kind and have gone above and beyond to help us. I had problems with my bank and have to give a special mention to the Assistant Manager on the first floor helped me tremendously! The staff has been fantastic but also I have to mention the food has been delicious. We met the main chef of the same club lounge level,  her name is Ankita, absolutely wonderful and deserves a special mention also. Delicious and the presentation was beautiful.  I 100% recommend this hotel to everyone!"
4246,RCKCHKU,5,I only stay here!,"I have been to this hotel many times.  It is the only place I stay in Mumbai.  It is so close to the airport and access out of town it is wonderful.  Just a reminder, that while close in ""miles"" dont underestimate the time it take to get around in any major Indian city.  The hotel is wonderful.  The rooms are clean, sized well, quiet and comfortable.  The restaurants are exquisite and varied.  I am very well taken care of whenever I am there."

This is my second visit to the hotel this year, and I look forward to coming back already. I would like to congratulate the staff and the hotel for a memorable experience and a fantastic visit. Every member of the staff from the bell dest to the reception , from concierge to the restaurant were well trained, professional and went out of their way to make my stay exceptional. I ate at two of the in house restaurants - China House and Cellini - both were TOP NOTCH - being a foodie, i was well impressed with their use of ingredients, presentation and overall feel.

4252,Manish S,4,Business hotel,I stayed with my family at Grand Hyatt mumbai. This hotel can be classified as business hotel and lacks things that can keep the kids busy. Hotel staff were also not cooperative in cleaning the milk bottles and other kids related things..  Room was spacious and good!! Breakfast was good!!   Hotel is far away from tourist destination..Good choice for business visit but not good for family holidays..
4253,PickyglobetrotterUk,4,Still a good business hotel,"Probably my 5th or 6th stay here so I know what to expect. Large hotel and I find the service to be generally very good. I did boycott for a while following a billing/service issue a year ago but have returned. About 30minutes from the airport (which, in Mumbai, is a very short journey time!). One of the best hotel buffet spreads I have seen anywhere."
4254,PaulStickland,1,Made of faux Marble and Paper M√¢ch√©,"When you enter the hotel it is opulent and your expectation of your stay is heightened, however the show did not match the billing.   I paid extra for the Lounge, which made sense as it included airport transfer, Internet, 24 hour lounge access, Cocktails and food and breakfast. I was allocated a room on the first floor to be close to the lounge (1130 to be precise).   I was looking forward to a good rest before my flight home, I had been away for 3 weeks, flown to the UK to Singapore, Chennai, Pune and this was a rest stop before my 15 hour journey back to Sydney.

4257,LuxeTravelerHK,3,Noisy Rooms - Time to Move On,I remembered my last stay being enjoyable and so decided to stay again yet after this stay I have realized that this hotel is no longer for me. The first room was unsatisfactory as it was a connecting room and I could hear word-for-word everything that the gentleman in the room next door was discussing on his many conference calls. That's not his fault and my concern was more about him being able to hear me on my calls. I paid a higher rate and moved to a suite room which was guaranteed to be quiet and it was. I appreciated the amount of light that the suite room got. The bedroom had floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides and for me is the perfect room set-up. However where the wall in the bedroom connects with the supporting pillar there was a 3-5mm gap and I could see sunlight‚Ä¶

Our International flights were cancelled just prior to us arriving at hotel due to the Air France strike. We mentioned this at reception when we checked in and they introduced us to the concierge straight away. The concierge took the details of the cancelled flights and called me in the room after around half an hour after we arrived; he conferenced me into his conversation with the Air France office in Mumbai and it was sorted. Special thanks to the hotel and concierge for this. We stayed on the fifth floor and the room was spacious and stylish; the bed very comfortable; fantastic shower and bath.

The suit was very well equipped, clean and spacious.  Breakfast was very reach and the hotel dining services are offering a wide verity of local and international cuisine.  Very good facilities such as executive lounge, swimming pool and gym. The location is very convenient if you want to stay not too far from the airport.

4264,Antony C,3,Mediocre Stay,Had to stay there for a meeting on 5th and 6th September. The hotel is undergoing renovation. the staff service was mediocre. Positive aspect is the proximity to the airport. The surrounding area of the hotel is typical Indian galli.

There were a few hiccups during my last stay, however this was noted by Arun Vishnu (a very competent team member that Grand Hyatt). I visited the Grand Hyatt with my husband (recently got married) and lets just say the Grand Hyatt were exception in every thing they provided to ensure our stay was a stay to be remembered! From a personalised pick up from the airport (besides the driver), all the staff knowing us by name, an upgrade to the Suite room to a last minute exception to letting me utilise my points earned to avail a free night. It was my husband's first time to Mumbai and he was extremely impressed with the attentive staff and personal touch which is very hard to find these days. I could go on with the list‚Ä¶"

The breakfast was good enough. Disappointing opening hours for the bar - it closed way too early - and the neighborhood is not really fantastic, plus you have the usual safety drills common to this area which make the experience a bit more scary (even if it is meant to be safer)."
4268,gameruz,3,Convinience,"I had a short two day stay.   The best part was that the hotel was just a 20 minute drive from the airport.   I was disappointed that they didn't offer a pickup.  It was also very convinently located near BKC,  a short 15 mins drive.  The room was quiet small,  but given the space crunch in bombay,  that should be expected.  The mini bar was too cramped with hardly any place to put more than a mug,   Had to juggle to make a coffee."
4269,Bruce D,5,Outstanding Club Experience,"This hotel has an excellent art collection--both varied and unique.  The rooms are very well done, but the highlight is the Club Lounge Experience--their evening happy hour featured amazing dishes and desserts from the many talented chefs in their kitchen, and I would like to especially commend the outstanding service by Navneet Sanil, he was ever present with whatever request I might have!"

But what is not expected is that there are flakes withering off from many of the panels in the facade of the hotel. If I am not wrong, some renovation work is in progress but anywhere else these areas would have been cordoned off and screens erected in front of these areas so as to keep these areas hidden from the public eye. Otherwise there is not much to complain of.  The ambiance is excellent and so too is the food. And the best part of it is its location really close to the airport. One word of caution.

However, you will be awaken in the morning by your neighbours as soundproofing is pitiful. Staff will ring your doorbell at 10am on a Sunday to check your minibar. But don't worry, you will already be up by9 on the weekend since there is plenty of hallway noise seeping into your pillow.  Slums approach the hotel from various directions.

As with most international 5-stars you have to go through a bit of security. The cheerful staff will help you and make this as easy as possible. Once you are inside, you can relax. Hotel is fairly big and and layout is a bit confusing, but staff will guide you around.  I got a very nice upgrade to a corner suite that was surprisingly well designed and and it good shape.

Hotel facilities and food was excellent. The conference halls were well equipped and comfortable. However, some staff members, though outwardly showed politeness, when we needed to get things done, were quite indifferent and appeared to work like machines without any feelings. This happened especially at the check in and the check out. Also, at the banquet, the head waiter refused to serve drinks as the it was just minutes pass the stipulated time though plenty of it were still available at the counter.

I stayed there between 15-17th of Aug and I have been calling the Hotel people close to 50 times in the last 2 weeks and I still have not gotten a proper response. After about 3 weeks of my stay, they informed that the transaction has been cancelled from their side. I still have no clue when the amount will actually get back to me.

I was particularly impressed by the fact that the staff realized that we were traveling with a small baby and they were prompt enough to get some baby supplies for us. A teddy gifted by the hotel to my princess was a pleasant surprise( which by the way is one of her favorite stuff toy). The staff at the lounge are just fabulous always there for you.

The breakfast buffet has so many choices I left full each morning.   The bar, called ""the bar"" has terrific pizza. Thanks to Sanjay (hope I spelled it correctly) for his great service and personality, yet another reason why my stay was a great experience.   Thanks so much.  "
4284,Freelander270,4,Located close to the airport,"I love this hotel for business trips. About half an hour from the airport, close to the business district of BKC and mid-way between South Mumbai and the business districts of Andheri East. Nice rooms, the usual Hyatt standard, nice restaurants and a great gym. My only complaint is no free wifi. They charge almost a 1000 rupees a day for it. Be warned though that there's noting to do after a day's work. There are no shopping arcades or restaurants or anything close to the hotel (except the hotel's shopping area). Can get a bit boring if one is staying multiple nights."

Clean and smooth which gives off an aura of class. No complaints.  I would have given this place 5 stars had my credit card not been blocked by them! Upon checking in, I requested at the reception not to use my credit cards for any extra purchases or services like dine-in, etc since I was going to use them for another personal use. I was willing to pay in cash and did pay so while checking out. After reaching my next onward destination, found out a sum of Rs 20,000(not a small one!) had been blocked by them! Cannot imagine why because I had paid money in cash. After repeated emails and nearly a month, the money was unblocked on my credit card. Even a silly mistake by a‚Ä¶"

We booked a honeymoon room, so we got our chocolate cake and bath full of roses which made our stay more romantic. Interior of hotel is fantastic with beautiful pieces of art   The location is great as everything is very close - airport, bandra and no far from colaba.  I would love to stay there again.  The dogs at the entrance are so lovely:-)"

Everyone here gave superb customer service. A lovely haven to return to after the hustle and hustlers of Mumbai. It is a big hotel with plenty of room to relax in the bars or restaurants. All staff speak impeccable English and are invariably polite. "
4288,Ted,4,Excellent hotel close to airport,"The Grand Hyatt is a excellent hotel. It is close to the international and domestic airport; between the hotel and the airport there is complementary taxi service. The hotel is an oasis of luxury with polite and service-oriented staff. Check-in late evening was smooth, although there was half-an-hour waiting-time as the room was not yet ready.  The room is spacious with well-equipped bath room. The room was not perfectly soundproof but that did not negatively influence the sleeping quality. Breakfast was ample and good. There are restaurants to choose from: Indian, Chinese, Italian. The bar is also well-equipped but it lacks some atmosphere."

On touring the property, I could notice the plaster of the building getting off from many places, which was not too good a sign from view of maintaining 5 star property...but apart from this aspect, there was nothing negative even minutely.

She will go out of her way to make you feel welcome.  Thank you Ms Rekha for your hospitality.  Yadnya Ms Yadnya is a very quiet young lady but went out of her way for me and all the other guest.

4299,neverhome76,4,Good but expensive for extras,"Not much to say about this typical 5 star from an emerging country. Very efficient and services/extras are very expensive. I paid 12 dollars for an espresso coffee in the lobby, which is the highest I have paid worldwide, including Florian's in San Marco square in Venice!  Breakfast is very good, all is very efficient, particularly if you consider you are in India. Close to the airport, I would recommend it."

We stayed in the Executive Club room and it was very clean, spacious and hygienic. They have complimentary tea/coffee all day and also Cocktails/Drinks from 6-8 pm for the guests staying in these room. The food was great as well and there were absolutely no complaints. The staff of this hotel have really maintained the standards of Hyatt. The service provided by Mr Yogesh Araukar at the Executive Club Lounge was very good and very professional. All in all it was an amazing stay and I definitely recommend this hotel for a luxurious and memorable stay."

I also had the best massage I've ever had in their spa!  I traveled with a co-worker with a food allergy and the staff remembered that and asked about it at all meals.  The rooms, gym, restaurant and lounge are all top notch!"

4306,Vedaant R,5,Wow for young hotel,"may be  Good might be mistaken, on a first glance at the lobby and hotel, for an unusually clean and cheerful youth hostel, an impression aided by its popularity among Indian tourists . hotel is a reasonably priced leap into an atmosphere of brightly colored whimsy and irreverence. The lobby features a photo booth, and an entire lobby has been decorated with lots of flower and beautiful looking things, . Restaurants are amazing and very tasty food with lots of choice . friendly staff with lots of welcome gesture and positive attitude . From Garden staff to high end staff all are professional. Security staffs are also very professional."

The hotel has I believe 7 restaurants.  We sampled 4 of them and found them to be excellent.  We had a terrific international buffet lunch at 55 East, great food and the sangria was included, we stayed 2 hours !  The wait staff was off the charts - many, many thanks to Mr. Promod, Mr. Sumeet and the assistant manager Mr. Parmar for making it a VERY memorable experience !  Chon & Fulu at the Oasis Spa were terrific and extrememly helpful.  The exercise room, sauna, steam room and whirlpool were all included.

I had the standard grand room with a balcony, loved being able to step out for some fresh air. With such a wide spread of restaurants - cuisine was never an issue. The only issue was that everything is quite a distance from each other cuz of the hotels size and that was alright - just built up my appetite.  Try the gourmet store that's secretly tucked in the shopping plaza side.."

The rooms are nice and modern with a fairly spacious closet. The closet has drawer with s glass front. Nice to find your clothing items. The shower is  very roomy. The carpet is a bit outdated. I don't like carpets, they are yuck-y. There are restaurants and the one where the breakfast buffet is served. The Italian was my favorite. really good food and very good value for yumminess.   The hotel has taxi service provided for a fee. Apparently reservation is not need as taxi is always available for you to hire. There is a shopping galleria with shoe stores (a Salvatore Ferragamo :)  included  )  Exploring the shops is a must (sigh). Last but not least I must say that‚Ä¶"
4314,Karl C,5,Lives up to the Hyatt Reputation,"Excellent property. Clean rooms, easy check-ins, good service. Swimming pool is one of the best. Gym is well equipped and well maintained. Sleep quality is very good and rooms are silent. The night club is quite good but not crowded even on a Saturday night (which may or may not suit you). Location is a bit of a downer as it it not close-by to anything. But then again its a small price to pay for the sheer space (the huge lobby area) and quietness (almost no traffic nearby) that the hotel offers."

I had the hotel pick me up from the airport, and as I arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by name by a very friendly hotel staff. As the reception was somewhat preoccupied at the time, I was brought to the foyer of the club lounge to be checked in. It was quite a sad sight unfortunately. It really doesn't reflect what I would expect from a Grand Hyatt. Nonetheless I was brought to my room after checking in, all was well. Lighting in the room is not great, something that the hotel should look into.   Bed was very comfortable, Breakfast was exceptional with a huge selection.  The club lounge was absolutely horrible in my books. I have never been so disappointed with a club lounge ever. The hot selection at the club lounge was only‚Ä¶"

4317,ingvoldSTAR,5,Perfect in almost every way,"the Grand Hyatt in Mumbai is one of the more upscale Grand Hyatts, not much different from Park Hyatt in many cities. The staff is friendly, security is diligent, food is great and the overall atmosphere has a nice mix of business and pleasure. Located in Santacruz, close to the airport and Bandra. In Mumbai, you'll have to have a car and driver anyway, so getting to South Mumbai is not an issue (unless you hit peak rush hour)."
4318,anupmasuneja,3,Housekeeping issues,"Have been staying in grand Hyaat for a while now but the last trip was quite a let down. Not only did I spot a cockroach in the room but when the housekeeping in charge came in and I reported that there is a cockroach, she asked 'where is it?'...and further without any sense of apology went on to ask - is everything else okay??? In opinion no one trains staff better on hospitality better than Oberois...hope somebody is listening and can take inspiration from the Oberois!!"
4319,Simon W,5,5 star allround,"Whilst always staying at this hotel for business purposes, I do look forward to my stay at the Grand Hyatt. The staff are very friendly and efficient and the hotel facilities excellent. The rooms are well equipped and the door to door car service from the airport to hotel convenient and hassle free.  The location of the hotel is ideal for me as my company's offices are located across the road."
4320,Michel S,5,Perfect business hotel,"If you are in Mumbai for business, stay in the Grand Hyatt. Simple as that. The room is good, enough space, and equipped with a good bathroom. Make sure to take the business package allowing for stay in the business club lounge and other advantages (airport service). Restaurants (I visited the Italian and Chinese) are good quality. Service is outstanding. Car services are good with experienced drivers (important if you want to reach your meetings in time). All in all: very good!"

Keep in mind these clothes are well over $1,000 US, and are STAINED and sticky. When I talked to the manager about this situation they said they would laundry my clothes. When I handed my clothes over to the laundry service they refused to my laundry because they said they would only wash the clothes they spilled wine on. No customer Service, No compensation, STAY AWAY!!"

The breakfast is four different cuisines and also here the service is excellent and very friendly. From the restaurants we tried the buffet style 55 East restaurant.

I have resided in almost all 5 star Hotels of Mumbai right from the days when Ramada Palm Grove used to  be a Hot Cake in Hotel industry. My experience with these had almost always been similar as i knew that i pay high so i m offered high standards, but Grand hyatt treated me good is what makes me spare out time and state a review on this hotel.

The experience started right from the approach to the Hotel which is now so easy which is something common Mumbai hotels. The event was hosted at the Ball Room and the entire arrangement was just awesome. At the onset of the gathering the experience was enhanced with cutting chai [Tea] which soon became a popular deman amongst the attendees and later on the delicious food just stole the hear away for all in presence there. A wide variety and awesome taste, everything so fresh as if cooked right then. Overall a great recommendation for any corporate event and specially for food lovers... :)"

The rooms are fantastic, a good size, very clean and modern. Two of the only niggles I have are with the room, the first is that the wardrobe space is far too small. Both rooms I had were the same and involved me removing the iron and dressing gown just to make a little more space, still not enough for all of my clothes. The other problem is wifi reception, very poor and I gave up on it. Works fine downstairs in the lobby and restaurants but awful in the rooms. LAN connections in the room work fine but forget it for tablets/phones. A shame really, if not for this then the hotel would tick all of my boxes. Outside of the room, the restaurants are excellent,‚Ä¶"
4327,Dipbast,4,Nice and Comfortable,"Stopped at this Hotel for a night while travelling back from Colombo to Kolkata. Overall impression was good - it was very near to Airport and though the roads to the Hotel was not that impressive, the interirors bore testimony to Hyatt standards. Well appointed rooms with excellent facilities and nice, courteous staff. The coffee lounge was also quite impressive. Just one thought (a bit insignificant though!) did not undestand the reason of the reception / check in counters being broken up into individual small desks like check in counters at airport. This kind of hit back probably because we are more used to seeing large grand looking reception counters in hotels - but anyway it is quite an insignificant observation. Overall impression - quite good"

The location of the hotel is quite far out from the central part of the city (30 mins) but the hotel were very good at providing local taxis which are reasonably priced and a set fee. The service was excellent from all staff but the wifi connection poor and parts of the hotel by the pool were covered with scaffolding and tarpaulin which was a shame.

We were reluctant at first as it is a bit of a distance away from Colaba, but our weekend was incredible due to the Grand Hyatt. Our room was very nice and had a great view of North Bombay. The room was spacious, with excellent snacks and an incredible bathroom/living space. The hotel had quite a bit of character to it, including an art gallery as well as a shopping mall.  The staff at the Grand Hyatt were excellent. They were incredibly thorough and very helpful, when it came to food recommendations, travel or anything we would need.

First, the location. This hotel is located in Kalina and it is just off the highway that leads to the airport. It's a well known hotel so most taxis will know where it is. Note that it is not close to any malls or restaurants or shopping. Essentially, you can't walk around to alternatives and are pretty much stuck there.  The location gives rise to the problem of transportation. This hotel is the only hotel I've stayed in where the hotel staff will refuse to call you a 'regular' taxi or a 'fleet' taxi.

Breakfast buffet was amazing with different cuisines and the croissants were yummy."

There is no need to leave the restaurant to enjoy some delicious cuisine,  The staff in the hotel are very helpful.  The Concierge helped book a car and tour guide for the city tour and Saturday.  We had a very ""tailored"" tour. Our guide was great and we were able to adjust our tour to the places we were interested in seeing.  Room service requests were quick and hospitality people were equally as quick.  Enjoyed the spa with a nice deep tissue massage.  The facility has a very nice gym and spa area.  Breakfast was great, service was excellent also.  We enjoyed our stay and would stay there again when we visit Mumbai."

Having locational advantage in terms of connect to important places in the city for work, like BKC or  towards South Mumbai, to having fairly distanced proximity to bandra and lower parel for leisure and shopping.   Classy yet contemporary design of the hotel has a catch of itself. Spaciously designed rooms and soothing embiance, makes it the right choice to stay after a hectic day at work or shopping.

I really appreciated that hotel staff accompanied me to my room upon check-in and walked me through the switches, the facilities and other essentials. The experience in the banquet area was not so great however. The night before our event - when set-up was in progress - banquet staff were not switching on the air-conditioning. I had to finally yell at them to do the needful - which they did with great reluctance. Food served in the banquet area for the event - was ordinary. The wi-fi connectivity was unbelievably awful - across the banquet areas, the public areas‚Ä¶"
4341,GeeKay7,5,An Excellent place to host a Conferrence...,We had a residential conference in Grand Hyatt.  I think this was the 4th or 5th time our conference was hosted here. Excellent place. Courteous and friendly staff. Smooth Check in and Check out. Great Food and nice ambiance.
4342,Woodcars,5,Excellent place to stay,"I had an extended stay due to business needs and never regretted my choice of hotels. The amenities and accommodations are top flight, and the staff goes out of its way to make you feel like your comfort and your business is appreciated. This is a far cry from some of the hotels I have spent more money in but felt less like a guest and more like an inconvenience, it's a refreshing change. The hotel has everything that a business traveler can ask for, and the four restaurants on the property make dining without leaving the hotel a pleasure rather than a chore. I can highly recommend this hotel."

4348,Anuj S,3,Not that great,"Though it is a very good hotel, and a very spaciaous one, I rate it at 3 because of the deficiency in the services they rendered. I had ordered food for in-room dining. I specified that I want 'butter' roti, and they served plain roti. That too after delivering the food 20 minutes late. Later, in the night I had a bad stomach and requested antacid at the concierge.  They asked for a doctor's prescription. Antacids across the world are OTC drugs and one doesnt require a doctor's prescription to buy that. Arguing this with them was useless and they refused to take my point. I then asked them what option do I have, I was told to take a cab and visit some medical store nearby.

I was in Mumbai on holiday and did not find the location of the hotel to bothersome for sight seeing. The staff was so welcoming that I would gladly return and stay again. I had minor issues with the internet but the staff was more then willing to assist me. I found that it was just dead spots in my room. Overall I had a truly wonderful experience, thanks to Jyoti, Kerun, Ankit and Pooja and everyone else's names I have forgotten!"

Things I liked...Big comfy beds and a great shower and the Cocktail hour in the club lounge..(though it would have been better if it was longer than 2 hours...)

THE GOOD- Having stayed for 7 nights in a row a couple of times, I appreciate the variety of dining options (buffet, Italian, Indian, Chinese), and well stocked bar. The rooms are large, clean and with excellent powerful showers. Towels and bedding are soft and comfortable.

4360,Neha,5,Excellent experience,"I spent 2 nights at the Grand Hyatt and I really enjoyed myself. The cleanliness of the room, the service provided by the staff and the overall ambiance was really good.  The check in and check out process was very quick and easy.  The food was good though a little on the pricey side especially room service. But, we have come to expect that in 5 star hotels.  Stayed in the grand room and had no complaints with regards to the room. Clean, well maintained, plush and comfortable.   The only negative was the fact that we chose a smoking room and so the entire floor had a smoky smell and so did the room.   I do plan to stay in Grand Hyatt the next time I am in Mumbai, it is money well spent."

4362,sk4nder,4,Winning Location for business,"I spent only one night at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai, and was suitably impressed.  It is located just 10 minutes from the Mumbai International Airport, so is very handy when arriving late in the evening, as most flights from Australia tend to do.  It is also closer to a number of business districts than the tourist hotels located at the bottom end of the city.  The hotel is purpose-built, housed in a newish, inward-looking compound with the hallmarks of a late 1980s monolith, but sporting all the mod-cons you'd expect from a hotel of this type - largish rooms, comfortable beds, clean and efficient - and an excellent breakfast array.  My one big gripe is wifi access.  It is confusing, and expensive.  In a hotel of this calibre (and price), wifi access should be included in the room‚Ä¶"

I checked out of the other hotel after one night because it was absolutely disgusting. I checked into the Grand Hyatt next a.m. It was like being delivered to an oasis. The Grand Hyatt delivers on all fronts: accommodations, service and all the above. Rooms were beautiful and spacious. All 5 restaurants on property were wonderful! Gym was incredible. Truly a 5 Star Hotel. In a city like Mumbai you will need an oasis like the Hyatt to retreat to."

The check in process was itself a put off. Talk about cocky staff man and your search will end here. Right from the front desk to the breakfast area. Smile means nothing to the staff here. I stayed for over 2 months here and I just couldn't get enough of the staff here. I could just go on and on about the STAFF in this hotel. The only advantage of this hotel is its location and that is it. I would like to suggest the staff here to visit Renaissance Marriott , Powai and Westin, Goregaon to take a crash course on how to speak to their clients.  Cocky staff thats the word for the Management here."

I chose the lady traveler option, which is a group of rooms catering to solo lady travelers. The room was like any other Grand Hyatt rooms - spacious with top end furniture and electronics. However, to make it a little more personalized, there was a bag of goodies as well as some rather fancy bathing salts and bathing products to make the experience more special. I absolutely loved the concept as they had taken care of everything that I would need. The staff was very courteous and service was impeccable, but this is understood.

The bed was very comfortable and the I actually used the toiletries provided, which I generally avoid. The TV channels however looked like it still gets old school analog signals.  The best parts of staying at Hyatt are the restaurant and the watering hole on the ground floor. I have always liked going there even when I am not staying at Hyatt.  Oh ya, before I forget, The breakfast buffet. I couldn't think of anything that wasn't served. It was a elaborate affair and everything tasted just perfect!"

The room was excellent and we had time for a bit of sun around the pool, which is nice. The staff were very nice and helped us out a lot.   It obviously caters for a lot of Business clients but is still personable. We ate at the Italian restaurant, which was excellent. In the morning Bfast was v busy but we were sat straight away and the selection to eat is fantastic.   The one negative is the bar, or lack of one. They basiclly have a big shelf full of spirits and lots of stools but it wasn't a very nice experence. The bar staff were rude, told me one ice cube was plenty!, and the prices were far higher than in many other chain hotels I have stayed in in India."

We were entitled to a three hour car tour but unless one knew where to go a guide would have been useful. Our driver, Ravi, did a wonderful job considering the more then usual traffic congestion. The previous day we were fortunate to have chosen a driver and guide leaving the ship. I can't say enough for the guide Mubeen Shaikh who out did himself showing us the highlights of Mumbai.

I was booked in the executive floor, I came in late in the night to check in, and the reception downstairs asked me to check in at the Executive floor, and I was not in the mood to go upstairs after waiting to check in again. These are one of the things which the hotel needs to look in.  The hotel was close to the airport, and had wide rooms and clean.   You will get the same rooms in any grand hyatt hotels.  The breakfast at the executive floor was good. Plus you get a free complimentary drop off at the airport when you stay there."

4391,mpk17,4,Smashing business hotel near Mumbai airport,"I stayed here on business for three days and it is a hotel at the top of its game. A bit big and pharaonic with a touch of Bollywood glitz and self regard, it is well looked after, well managed and the staff to a man are superbly trained. I asked the valet for a button to be sewn on to my shirt and the shirt came back 1 hour later mended, laundered, pressed and starched to perfection. Lovely property with an excellent gym and good restaurants, there is no reason to ever leave.   The only downside is that if you have business in central Mumbai you are looking at a good two hours in traffic to get there and back. It is important to take this into consideration as traffic just seem to be getting worse."

It's 10:30pm and the music (heavy on drums and bass) and crowd noise from a special event 2-3 levels below my room is so loud the room is shaking.  Two calls to the duty manager have proved useless, ""I understand"" is not a solution.  Offer of a room change does me no good as I am trying to get to sleep and don't want to have to pack up my things and move.

The rooms are very well maintained, well appointed, always in working order and clean. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Of course no hotel in Mumbai is cheap in internaional comparison, but this at least offers value for money."
4400,joohn_1981,2,Business package scam,"I had booked 2 nights thru a travel agent and arrived 4:30 in the morning from a long international flight. The check-in staff offered me a business package for some 3000 Rs, including airport transfer, Wifi, and breakfast. Check-in staff said it was 3000 Rupies for the whole stay, not per day. At check-out they did not only charge 3000 Rs twice (per day) but also breakfast charge was on the bill, additionally to the business package charge. The check out staff explained breakfast was included in the package, but not where I had taken it but in some other area, whatever. The check-in staff had just mentioned breakfast was included, so I had it at the regular breakfast area...  However, they would remove the breakfast charge from the bill upon my complaint, which is positive. But‚Ä¶"
4401,SSM,4,Excellent machine,"I love this hotel. We have been hosting conferences at this hotel for the past 7-8 years and the experience is excellent. The check in process is very fast, the rooms are very well appointed, service of the Room Service and Housekeeping folks in brilliant. Once really can't compare the F&B outlets of this hotel with others and I think that their Breakfast Buffet spread is hands down one of the best in the country. Food at 55east and China Kitchen is legendary too. Yeah the coffee shoppe downstairs in the retail mall is a bit too expensive and not worth the price. I also think they need to do away with their China House disc and do something better. Horrible to see a place with just about 2 people in it. Overall I love the hotel."
4402,AbhijeetRanadive,4,"Business Conference at Grand Hyatt, Mumbai","Visited Grand Hyatt near the new Mumbai International Airport for a Business Conference. Was surprised by the opulence of the hotel and the great designing done in a relatively small area. The food, especially the startres and the desserts were just amazing. The conference room location was a bit to the side with no clear emergency evacution signs etc, but the overall design and planning of the hotel is great. Will defenitely recommend this for business."
4403,SagnikIndian,4,Excellent stay,"I stayed here for one night during my business trip. I stayed here earlier trip and I must say its very good. Airport pick up was not prompt, we need to wait long and was getting irritated, nut once inside the hotel, everything were good."

Rooms are very nice, big and comfortable ... so, that's great.  Lobby and overall hotel is in good shape.  Close to airport, etc.  Lots of goodness you would expect of a Grand Hyatt.  On check in, there was not much of a line ... just 1 person ahead of me.  The staff decided to take me to the club lounge to check in instead.  Made no sense.  I walked down a few halls, elevator, more halls, to a desk outside the lounge.  In that time, I am sure the 1 person ahead of me would have been in his room and I would have been done checking in.  No sense at all.  But what irritated me, was the restaurant being closed.  I had been here before and their buffet venue was pretty good, so I was looking‚Ä¶"
4405,I_am_Max,5,Excellent Hospitality @ Grand Hyatt Mumbai,I stayed at Grand hyatt for a short business trip and really liked the ambiance.

The Rooms were very spacious and the bed is comfortable. all this comes at a very genuine price :)

Great Hospitality,"I stayed during the weekend.. the room was very spacious and comfortable as I was staying alone... room service is prompt and the staff were very nice... check-in was smooth, hassle-free.. gym was superb.. very neat.. enjoyed my evening work-outs. The best part was that i was running late after checking out and i thought i'll miss my flight.. but thankfully the guy at the concierge called up his colleague at the airport and he kept my boarding pass, i was able to board the flight.  Looking forward to the next stay!"
4408,Todd W,5,Preferred Stay in Mumbai,"This was my 3rd stay at the Grand Hyatt after previously staying at the JW. The hotel itself is ideally situated for easy travel and is relatively close to the airport from a time perspective - 20 mins in light traffic. The exterior of the hotel is a little weather beaten but under repair. The interior is immaculate. I enjoy the layout of the rooms in that it situated the bathroom and closet in a way that provides a buffer from hallway noise which is important when you are sleeping days as I do in Mumbai. This trip I only had breakfast in the hotel - American style. The eggs, bacon, and breads were all very well done. The potato serving was smallish but not unsatisfying. The coffee was my only complaint in that it was not as hot as I prefer and some grounds had escaped into the‚Ä¶"
4409,mikeyg624,5,Comfortable business hotel,"Always stay at this hotel.  Very close to the airport and can be in bed within 20 minutes of leaving the airport.   Food selection is good, but a little expensive.  However, I only eat in the hotel since I have never gotten ill from the food inside the hotel.  Staff to guest ratio must be 2:1 at least! There is an abundance of people all over the place making sure you are well taken care of.  One of the best deals about this hotel is the long-stay offer for 7 nights or more: well worth it! Includes Internet, breakfast, airport transfers and laundry discount.  Since I never come for less than a week, I always luck out on this great deal.   Pool is relaxing.  Health club and spa facilities are very good.  Only thing lacking is a sundries store for drinks, snacks or magazines.  ‚Ä¶"
4410,Asish Dash,4,Good..but for the price range it misses on a few vitalities,"My first stay in Grand Hyatt but definitely not in Mumbai. I would like to elaborate a bit for fellow travellers:  Pros: i} Location: Its situated pretty close to the Western Express Highway and gives you better connectivity even during peak traffic. ii} Security: Feel very safe thanks to the extensive security checks iii} Grand: The size of the property is quite big and in synonymous with other Grand properties and in line with the competition in the same range. iv} Rooms: Rooms are well maintained, and yet it just celebrated 10 years they do not look tired in most areas...Some shortcomings are there, described in below section. v} Restaurant: Good number of options vi} Facade/ Internal asthetics are well done and offer unique experience in itself. vii} Check-in was really‚Ä¶"

On the flip side, which, in my opinion outweighs all the good about this hotel: 1. Food-I ordered for Indian and it was simply 'pathetic' - preparation, taste, everything! & 2. You must answer you door in 2 knocks; 'coz if you don't, their staff (probably on a routine visit) might just use their master key and barge in!"

The service levels were heighteded even further. no one complains when they are welcomed with a complimentary wine bottle in their room!

Location is perfect for folks who have business in and around the airport area or in Navi Mumbai."
4413,Duke_Singapore,2,Nothing extraordinarily Grand.,"I had stayed at the Hyatt Regency Mumbai many times and liked it.  This was my first time at Grand Hyatt Mumbai and I had impressions that it would be ""grander"" than the Regency version.  I was somewhat wrong: * Check in was prompt but impersonal. * The room was about standard size - still smaller than the Regency I was used to. * The bathroom used reddish brown marble so it felt a bit dark.  It had a nice walk-through robe.  But what I disliked most was that the shower had no door and the shower spillage can be quite extensive.  Worst, the floor became dangerously slippery! * Breakfast was nothing spectacular or memorable.  There were lots of staff - maybe as many as the guests.  But what spoiled my experience was how long it took for me to be served my eggs and toasts - I‚Ä¶"

During our breakfast, there was a fly on the food and when told to the waiter he just apologised and changed the plate, yea!! Like am gonna feel like eating after that. There were flies around our seat and hence the waiter called a guy with the PCI uniform who stood there with a racket killing flies around us, yuk!!!

The staff and the service they provide are truly wonderful.  I have a room on the 6th floor with a view to the large inner courtyard.  The bed is very comfortable, and the bathroom has every amenity I could wish for, including things not usually provided like deodorant, mouthwash, travel wash for hand washing clothes, shaving kit, comb, and more. The shower is a slightly unusual wet room arrangement next to the bath, but the pressure is fine and it works well.

One of the staff, Chayya, became such good friends with me and still is. She treated us like prestigious guests and made sure that our stay was made perfect.  She made sure any question concern or request  was answered. She always was smiling and just brightened up your day. When you meet Chayya at the hotel you will know who she is.The people, hotel, location, and gym was the best. I will be staying here every time I come To Mumbai."

Check in was very slow as many travellers arrived around the same time and the hotel clearly doesn't have sufficient check in staff. I was sent to the Club Floor for check in but there was only one attendant up there, so the wait continued. However, this was the only small issue. The hotel and the rooms are in very good condition considering that this property is just celebrating its 10th anniversary.  My room faced the courtyard, was well equipped with all key amenities and it was nice and tranquil. The WIFI worked well in the whole hotel. Breakfast was adequate but not superb.

The rooms are spacious and modern with ample room for luggage and space to move around in general. The bathroom is also great. The reception area is transformed by the artworks in the lobby area that makes it welcoming. However, it took the staff almost 1 hour to check in 6 passengers which was disappointing. The hotel has too many mosquitoes in the lobby area too. The breakfasts were great with a choice of American and Indian breakfast. However, the waiters in the main restaurant need some attention - we would order something and they would forget completely or bring the wrong order.

4441,convie,4,Why charge for WIFI,This was my 4th stay at Grand Hyatt. The hotel is great. Staff are friendly. Breakfast and food is great. The only issue I have is being charged for wifi.  Most hotels around the world provide free wifi.  Another negative is the overcharging or charging at all for airport transfers. I understand that the hotel cannot charge the same rates as local taxis but 7 times the local taxi fare is a rip off.  Fix these two and this will be the best hotel in Mumbai.

The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I wasn't allowed to carry a single piece of luggage (all in a good way).  The room was fantastic! Extremely well appointed and a bathroom to die for. On check out the receptionist walked me from the hotel to the car which took me to the airport. I was blown away by this kind and warm gesture. The hotel is not too far from the airport which was great for missing peak hour traffic.

4448,TigerKolkata,4,Accessible with a few hurdles,Stayed for the 5th time in the last 8 months and always choose this hotel due to its perfect location for my business as I shuttle between Bandra and Andheri.  The hotel is doing roaring business and has a fine Chinese restaurant. The downside is the executive lounge needs desperate refurbishment and so many new faces on the staff means getting information can be a challenge. Thankfully the GM is very hands on so reach out to him if the need is urgent.  Overall service is good.

Since that time, I have now stayed there on 6 occasions and it is no exaggeration to say that each stay is as good as the previous one ‚Äì if not better.  Grand Hyatt Mumbai does NOT conform to the sad norm that seems to affect many hotels where lack of maintenance and investment lead to structural dowdiness and an associated lack of pride and motivation amongst the staff. It is quite the opposite!!!!!!!!

The lobby floor is spacious and grand without being ostentatious and the staff are attentive and friendly. There are restaurants for all tastes, including one open 24 hours for the jet lagged gourmet and a 24 gym to work off the desserts.  Room was fantastic and equipped with all the extras.

Of course in this area you can not expect any views, but we found the room very dark even when all lights were switched on (a very annoying experience to go around the room trying to find every switch - master switch was little help). This wasnt helped by the dark wood in the room. Bathrooms remain in good condition throughout. As everywhere in this area, a tremendous amount of noise from the street at all times.

Only 5 - 10 minutes from the domestic terminal and about 25 minutes to the international airport. It‚Äôs a perfect place to stay if you want to enjoy Mumbai 5* hotel hospitality without having to go into central. Compared to the Regency, you obviously notice the difference.  Lots of positives.

Who ever is in charge of the club lounge needs to be promoted to run the rest of the hotel as the downstairs lobby caf√© struggled on many levels - to slow, you are not allowed to move a table (even if there is 15 of you) and mistakes are made with the food. The restaurant's were all really good and staff generally competent and friendly - but they all fell well short of the standard set by the staff in the club room lounge."
4460,SanjDev,5,One of the best near the airport,"Impressive and large, spacious lobby with eye-catching art pieces all around, adding a cultural touch to the hotel's aesthetics. But I think they should have an escalator leading up directly to the check-in counters. One has to physically walk up the stairs to reach them - not friendly for the handicapped or aged.  Check-in was fast and smooth. Particularly impressed by the service language adopted by the staff. Not only did they look good and presentable, they were also articulate and ever-ready to extend a helping hand. Staff by the name of Mahesh Anandache went the extra mile by ensuring that my stay was comfortable and memorable, providing chocolates specially delivered to my room. He also made a conscientious effort to interact with me & share tips on the best places in‚Ä¶"
4461,ShwetaMaheshwari,5,Excellent property,"I am a total fan of this hotel and stay here each and every time. All the restaurants are great, but China House is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants outside of China.the staff were wonderful, the housekeeping were good, food was great. All in all a beautiful hotel with good staff Keep up the good work."
4462,270Sunny,4,Nice property...,"I had been to this place in November , found the property really nice and huge , very clean .. it also has one of the best night clubs i mumbai... the rooms were clean , though i found it to be a bit on the smaller size.,,, the staff was courteous but made me a wait a bit longer than expected ....."
4463,sachiv g,3,Cant have better experience than this !!,"A great hotel w.r.t food, location, hospitality. Staff and Manager were really courteous and helpful.  Although they have many problems like a problem of door keys not working or trouble opening up the rooms in the hotels, those one seems to be very common or can say uncommon for the staff to know about it, the hotel staff managed it very tactfully by upgrading me to a suite during my dinner time. . I really appreciate the front desk manager to handle such situations. Being a regular, Hope to get the better service and room during my next visit which is likely to be month end."
4464,Citygal23,4,Excellent Hotel,"The hotel check in was swift and efficient. Concierge is very helpful and will go the extra mile. The night we checked in the bathroom was dirty and there wasn‚Äôt any hot water from the shower or bath. I called the housekeeping and the hotel housekeeping manager came up to my room, addressed the problem very professionally and offered to change my room. I was very pleased with the change of room and we braced with chocolates and flowers on a daily basis. A very nice gesture from the hotel. Will definitely recommend to all my friends and family around the world."
4465,AbhayTilwankar,4,Making you feel special,"The staff of the hotel surely is aware of how to make guests feel special. Stayed for a night for a business event at the Banquet Hall.  The room was spacious and well planned. The furnishings were rich and pleasant. The washroom was well spaced out with a special shower and the wardrobe integrated. The toiletries were good too.  The breakfast buffet was a good spread across regional tastes and cuisines, both Indian and Continental.   Overall a good experience.  Although we had a little problem getting the Banquet Hall at the right time , delayed due to an enthusiastic group of revelers from a private party."
4466,SunitaF1,5,Weekend stay,A great business hotel which is always on the go and buzzing with lots of events taking place.  Great breakfast spread at Fifty Five East.  Spacious rooms.  Great service. Close to Mumbai's domestic airport.
4467,ashokude,4,good stay,nice property had been here twice before and very close to airport  and good staff except in restaurant.very good breakfast that fetch u  enough calories for whole of the day .Light switches in the room are unfriendly
4468,Grant W,5,Over Nighting in Mumbai?,"As I had previously stopped in the Grand Hyatt in New Delhi on what is my first business trip to India, I decided that my experience there was worth trying to repeat. I can only say I wasn't disappointed. The warm welcome from the staff, the excellent Check in experience, the explanation of the facilities etc, etc was first class. Again my room was just what I would expect from this hotel group and the service levels from all the staff was excellent. The restaurant was really nice with the food and wine of excellent quality. I didn't get time to experience all the facilities but they looked to be fantastic and if I go back i will certainly make time for a little relaxation around the pool etc. Again breakfast was most enjoyable especially with the friendly staff only too willing‚Ä¶"
4469,Tan T,5,Excellent 5 stars,End to end grand service from check in to check out. Awesome breakfast spread and layout of rooms and facilities gives maximum privacy. Crowded with business travellers as a sign of great service and quality.
4470,Dr. Satyajit Borah,4,Superb hotel,"It was my second stay at the Grand Hyatt and I recommend this property for a comfortable and hassle free stay at Mumbai. Rooms are reasonably bigger, with all amenities, food was great and lobbies and other public areas were expansive to relax and spend some quality time. The fresh fruit basket supplied complementary in the room every day is really thoughtful. My 3 nights of stay was really memorable. "
4471,yogesh bhatia,4,Amazing facilities,"Though this is considered as one of the best hotels in Mumbai, rooms are not that great.  Apart from that they have excellent gym facilities, steam, spa and amazing breakfast. I was on the business trip and stayed around one month and must admit I didn't missed home.  I forgot to carry sports shoes, gym staff happily gave me a pair for temporary use, this was example of great service. Though I felt people at reception were bit cold but I pass the benefit of doubt that it may be due to huge rush they have.   I got membership for Hyatt immediately and its my preferred property in Mumbai."
4472,KavithaK1102,5,Great hotel!,"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai during my recent holiday to Mumbai... A wonderful experience, great rooms and friendly staff. Excellent service received at the Front Desk and Concierge. Thank you to all for a great time"
4473,manoharwwwww,5,Amazing Place to stay in,"I have been using this hotel for a very long time. I can truly say that its a home away from home.The hotel is very modern as well as extremely big. The staff are very friendly and efficient especially in the Grand Club. I would suggest the Management should change the flooring to wooden instead of carpet.The food and service in all the restaurant here, are simply splendid. However the Mineral water should be made complimentary and the fruits kept should be warm instead of being chilled during the breakfast buffet spread at Fifty Five East. The wine served during buffet lunch and dinner should not have fruits in them.  Club guest should have complimentary access to the China House Lounge. The room decor is simply amazing and the fruits placed in the room are also fresh and best‚Ä¶"
4474,Wayne L,5,Stayed 2 nights in January 2014.,"My family and I had a fantastic stay at the Hotel. We were initially greeted and attended to by an Assistant Manager on duty, Dimple. Dimple's efforts were outstanding regrading her attire, manners and attention to detail. Travelling with 3 children can sometimes be difficult, Dimple made sure all our requests were met with a smile an immediate action. Based on the way one gets treated at the Grand Hyatt, I would definitely stay here again."

Stage, lighting, flowers looked well decorated   Food - Delicious ... Mostly live counters with chef catering to your personal taste  Service - Brilliant   "
4476,Arnaud P,5,My Mumbai favorite,"When travelling to Mumbai, I always go to the Grand Hyatt because the atmosphere of this hotel is quite something, especially in the Grand Club where the staff, managed by Anubuthi is extremely pleasant. The rooms are very large and fully refurbished last year and no less than 5 restaurants, all very good with a special mention to Soma and China House."
4477,ColbyWWilson,5,Nice Place to Live,I have been living in this hotel since last October. That facilities are wonderful and the staff is Spectacular. I recommend this hotel highly. There are great restaurant options onsite from full Buffet to China Star and also (of course) Indian. China House also has a night club onsite as well for those looking for a little night life.
4478,Sayer,5,An oasis not far from the airport,"We ended up booking this hotel at short notice on the Saturday after Christmas. This was due to plane problems in Heathrow we missed our connecting flight to Goa. Booking at such short notice meant that we got a very reasonably priced deal from Booking.com.   After all the stress and hastle at Mumbai domestic terminal arriving at the Grand Hyatt, which is a relatively short journey (about twenty minutes on a quiet Saturday evening) from the airport in the reception of the hotel was like finding a cool and sophisticated oasis in the desert.   My party consisted of my wife and I and my two teenage children. We stayed in two Grand Suites. The check-in was very good with excellent service from the front desk. This was despite the details from Booking.com not having been received by‚Ä¶"
4479,David J,5,Best Hyatt So Far,"Very pleased with the attention to detail and the overall product and services provided. Very bright rooms, hallways and restaurants. Restaurants were outstanding. Breakfast buffet superb. Pool was beautiful (although it could have been a little deeper). Loved the soaps provided in the room. Views in the courtyard were great. My only complaint was the person who checked me in did not tell me the package I was opting for with breakfast, wifi, etc. came with drinks at the lounge every night - I missed out on that! Otherwise a splendid hotel and very able to deal with difficult requests. Thank you for a lovely 3 night stay! Beats the heck out of other Hyatt's I've stayed at in my native US."
4480,GOLDPKJ,5,Very Good,"I stayed in this Hotel last week with my wife & very happy to choose the same .  Hotel rooms are very good , spacious , well planned with all accessories .  Bathrooms are also well planned with all amenities .  The Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful .  Its Breakfast spread is very good , one of the best in this category of Hotels & excellent food .   Overall my stay was comfortable ."
4481,Kaushik242,5,Excellent Hotel in Mumbai,Grand Hyatt is one of best hotels I have stayed in Mumbai. They are located not far from the airport.Excellent rooms and excellent breakfast. Very courteous staff.Have different dining options though bit expensive.
4482,koenraad17,2,Probably unlucky??,"Checked in for few days in Grand Hyatt Mumbay. While front desk was efficient, and I felt ok by entering the room, I was quite annoyed that I did not have free Wifi. Even that the front desk explained how to logon on the network, I was surpriesed that they forgot to mention that it was not FOC..  The fruit in the room was there for decoration since few days I guess, coz the apple was not really fresh. The toilet flush kept on slowly running, but you could hear it at night. Washbassin clogged in the morning, few hours later it was back to normal.  On top of that , the welcome card in the room was addressed to other guest, which is a minor thing. Everybody can make mistake."
4483,Beas B,5,Grand style and elegance attached !!!!,Stay initiated by my friend in Mumbai and this was my first stay in this hotel and my experience nevertheless was nothing but excellent . It's a nice hotel and it's perfect for business travellers like us . Grand Hyatt is not only a star hotel but displays the roots of international hospitality . I prefer to stay on the higher floor and would be obliged if my request is initiated the next time . Thanks to all . Super guys ..... Kudos !!!!!!
4484,SundipK,5,GRAND every time,"This was my 2nd time at Grand Hyatt and the experience was GRAND indeed this time as well..  The hotel was completely booked...in fact overbooked that tells me that people like to come to this hotel. However it appeared to me that the hotel staff was having tough time managing so many guests. First time I saw a big line at the entrance of the hotel to get inside...had not experienced yet anywhere. On the first morning, went for the breakfast and was also found myself waiting for 10 minutes to get the seat....It was funny to watch that it was like musical chair to grab a seat and the staff was really running around to take care of the guests. The hospitality and courtesy of the staff was excellent thru out.  The location is the best advantage for me to choose this hotel as it is‚Ä¶"
4485,VIKAS BALLY,5,Grand Hyatt Mumbai....lives upto its name....Great place to be..when in Mumbai,"Oh wow....thas what i feel when i reached Grand Hyatt for my first ever stay here. Thanks to tripadvisor and their advisors on whose advice i choose this hotel for my family stay. An ultimate two nights stay with an excellent prices and offers. I logged in through teh website of hotel and booked my room 10 days in adavance and got good  offer. What i liked the most was: - Excellent reception at reception desk - quick room tfr - ultimate an dvery comfortable room for complete family - i had given special request for my 7 months baby where the hotel provided my so many baby items, bed etc free of cost . I loved that - Excellent room service -Wow the best part was breakfast... Excellent preparations thanks to chefs and their team. - The place and hotel was awesome. - Very good‚Ä¶"
4486,Ashutosh S,5,Splendid Experience,"I stayed n the hotel for my wife's birthday and I could not have chosen a better option then Grand Hyatt. I may not be their regular customer but I got a royal treatment. The courteous behaviour and hospitality runs in the veins of these hoteliers....be the receptionist, the bell boy, the club lounge staff or the managers, everyone ensured that we have a wonderful experience. My wife was gong crazy with the food varieties and taste. The club lounge is the one of the best experience I had across any star hotels.My plate & glass was never empty at any point of time :) The USP of the lounge was the smile and always ready to help attitude of the employees which no perks/high salary can bring....i am literally wondering how is this possible every hour and every day...just amazing.‚Ä¶"

Would like to suggest the check in staff to smile a bit more - makes one feel welcomed !! The rooms are nice and well maintained- got a room with a tree in front of the window , so cant say much about the view --  The china room restaurant  is good but hugely expensive !!!  The night club is so so . Overall its a good place to stay ."

4496,AdeH0,3,Drastically different experience for both stays,"I did 2 trips in the space of 3 weeks and stayed at the Grand Hyatt both times.    On my first trip, I arrived to check-in and was pleasantly surprised to be told by the front desk that they have arranged for me to have a room on the 6th floor which was the ladies floor.  I thought that was a really thoughtful gesture for female guests.  It was also just after the Diwali holidays so some businesses were still closed and the hotel was running on low capacity.  Everywhere in the hotel, staff was really attentive and gracious.    On the second trip, I was told that the hotel was running at high capacity and all standard room rates were full and only a club room rate was available.  My first stay was a rather great experience and so I didn't mind paying more.  On arrival, I was sent‚Ä¶"
4497,Herv√© G,4,home sweet home,Grand Hyatt Mumbai in Kalina is like home.  Everything is cosy and made to make you feel home.  The staff is very kind and helpful but less professional than the staff of Four Seasons Worli.   Nonetheless staying at Grand Hyatt Mumbai is always a great experience.   The only less positive point is the food‚Ä¶ a little tasteless at the Italian restaurant and at the caf√© in the lobby. The rooms are very comfortable and clean and quiet.
4498,Zev K,5,Excellent experience,I stayed at the hotel on the beginning of January.  The hotel is beautiful. The staff did everything it can to please me.

We had the breakfast ( buffet) the next morning and the quality of the food,presentation and service is par excellence.I enjoyed what ever I tasted specially the south Indian and the Sambar.I enjoyed the most. The Gym and the pool are very good.One can just laze around the pool in the sun after the swim. The Grand is the best place to stay in when you are in Mumbai."
4504,Marie Falk,5,"Grand Hyatt, Mumbai review",Amazing Hotel experience from my recent business trips. Friendly staff and always providing an excellent service. All the restaurants are keeping an outstanding experience. The Grand Club Lounge where I stay on a regular basis every month has shown to be one of the best experiences that I have had within any Hotel. I especially want to extend a big thank you to Rajesh Paliwal who is always up to date with any guest requests and needs. Looking forward to be back next week.
4505,Eleonora N,5,Happy Long Stay Business Guest,"Grand Hyatt Mumbai is one of the best hotels I have stayed in Mumbai ‚Äì its location, amenities, rooms and last but not least friendly staff makes the stay at the hotel enjoyable. The Grand Club Lounge adds enormous value to my stay at the hotel ‚Äì it is not only the conference rooms, business center and the lounge, but also the relaxing atmosphere and the ever smiling and helpful staff which makes the difference after long business hours. The hotel is also convenient and comfortable for any business related events."
4506,theonlyvarun,4,"Best location, mid way between the airport and town","Grand Hyatt Mumbai, is an excellent hotel.The staff really pamper your every need and try their best to please you. Would definately recommend it to those who can afford it. Front desk staff are very efficient and use their descretion to offer the best value.  Food is also amazing their several restaurants, bar and pubs. They have a  Japanese chef who dishes out some of the best sushi.Rooms are a bit noisy since the doors are designed to shut with a bang."
4507,Matt D,5,Outstanding Service,What sets this apart from other 5 star options in Mumbai is the staff - they provide a fantastic service and are incredibly helpful.  Given the location close to the airport the Hotel is quiet and rooms are spacious and clean.  Plenty of entertainment options.
4508,sqflyerboy,5,This Hotel's Strength Is Its People,"Having spent over 100 nights at this property I figured it was time I wrote a review.   This hotel is one of the best in Mumbai. The property is large and very pretty with a luxurious lobby that houses an impressive collection of art. The rooms are small (par for the course in Mumbai) but very well furnished with many earthy wooden tones of brown and beige. Bathrooms are also well appointed and spacious with a full sized bathtub and shower.  This hotel's strength is definitely its team members which provide enthusiastic and polite service. There are many notable members that have provided commendable service over the duration of our stays.   In Guest Relations I would like to note Mahesh.

Also, special thanks to Yogesh at the club lounge who kept my guest busy in my short absence ."

Shabby service at the Indian restaurant, food was very ordinary. Breakfast was good. Room was very noisy, lots of people shouting in adjacent rooms. this is the third time I have stayed there in 2013. totally avoidable"
4512,Josh,4,As expected,"You expect a certain standard from the Grand Hyatt, and the Grand Hyatt Mumbai certainly didn't disappoint.  The hotel provided me with the comfortable, final night stay in Mumbai that I was seeking, along with a comfortable and friendly transfer to the airport at sparrow's fart o'clock the following morning. My club package also provided access to a cocktail hour that provided an opportunity to have a drink and a few snacks in my relatively quiet environment.  The highlight for me was certainly the bathroom. The bathroom was large, well-provisioned and equipped with a full size bath... I had an excellent time relaxing in that piece of porcelain!"
4513,JonniP,2,Nice hotel but terrible management staff ruin experience,"I was at GH Mumbai for 3 weeks on business for 10 days my wife joined me. I normally stay at the Regency near the airport but thought I would try the GH.   Firstly the food is excellent as is the bar and the service in these areas.  The rooms are decent and clean.   However:.  Reception staff are incredibly stuck up, do not listen to what you are asking for and do the bare minimum for the guest. Not really what you expect from a Grand Hyatt or any 5*hotel.  The workers that are in the driveway I have no idea what they are there for. They don't help you out the car or help you with your bags. They will just stand and watch you struggle.   The concierge is clueless, I went there everyday for 20 days and took a hotel car to the same location yet he could never remember me or where‚Ä¶"

4516,sunil_padmanabh,5,ideal place to stay in mumbai,"The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of mumbai and close to business districts, shopping areas and has great choice of restaurants and is just 15 mts away from the airport. The staff are very courteous."
4517,Asier M,4,Good hotel but far from South Mumbai,We spent four days in the hotel back in December 2013.  The hotel is very nice and the service is very good. The only problem is that the hotel is quite far from South Mumbai. At rush hours it might take around one hour and half to reach Kolaba.
4518,Clayton I,5,Nice oasis away from the Mumbai madness,"We chose to stay here because it was close to the airport and our flight got in after midnight. I really enjoyed my stay. The room was nicely appointed and I especially liked the open shower design. The bed was also super comfortable. The staff were always professional and seemed to be trained well in international hospitality standards. The hotel had a fully equipped and modern gym and the pool was a nice place to relax beside for the day. It is a little far to go to get to some of the main tourist attractions like the Gateway of India, but we accepted this and were OK with the distance. Being away from everything, the Grand Hyatt is a nice sanctuary away from Mumbai's bustling streets. I also thought the food was very good and a varied menu from local, asian to italian."
4519,1960manu,4,Very convenient if you have to take a flight the next day,Stayed here for a night. They sent a limousine to pick us from the airport. The check in was on the club floor. It was quiet fast. Room was adequate. Television didn't have much choice of channels. We ordered room service for dinner. Service was quick. Food is just Ok. Breakfast was served in the club floor. Limited choice in the buffet. The tables are very small. Overall it was good.
4520,adanie2,2,They cannot process refund of deposit for more than a month,I stayed in Grand Hyatt on November 21st. They blocked Rs 5000 in my debit card for a single night business trip. When I checked out they said no extra charges and so will process refund. It's been more than a month now and despite multiple reminders from my side they keep promising the refund and still not able to do it. Avoid staying in this place or add Rs 5000 to the room rate they quote since they do not refund the deposit anyways. I have made two other business trips since then and have received refunds from both those hotels already!
4521,Ranchi_doc,2,Needs Drastic Makeover,This hotel is a disappointment ! Primarily meant for international business travelers . A big letdown of indian hospitality standards . Most of the staff appeared quite reserved and unwilling to help . The food was ok but nothing great about it . This was my second stay here and the same experience both time ! Better to opt for Taj or Oberoi anyday !
4522,jenabaintheworld,3,service is really slipping--- regretably won't ever go back,"I stayed here again in December 2013, and this was not a good visit.   Service level is really slipping, the restaurant is jammed for breakfast and it's a wait to be seated, and reception is not well informed.    I've been here several visits (15+) over the years, and i'm sorry to say this will be my last visit.    There are so many other good hotels in the BKC area, and more with each month, so thankfully there is plenty of other choice."
4523,ptd496,5,Oasis in Mumbai,One of my favorite properties anywhere in the world. Conveniently located for domestic and even international airport terminals. Cars are always on standby for transportation. Authentic Italian restaurant and good service throughout. Also a nice fitness center and spa.
4524,catherine l,4,Good hotel with excellent Chinese restaurant,"Stayed 19 nights for business trip, hotel is well equipped with gym and steam room. Room is clean and many tv channels to choose from. Excellent Chinese restaurant and Italian restaurant. Do note that this hotel charges for internet access which can prove to be inconvenient for business traveller. Another drawback is they take in tonnes of Chinese tour group so the breakfast service can gets quite crowded and chaotic."
4525,Olbra555,4,Great business hotel near airport - BAD WIFI!!!,"Second stay in 3 months, liked the rooms and food, convenient location for a late arrival, due to the proximity to the airport. The hotel was very full so got upgraded to the Grand Floor, which is mainly lounge access with bfst as well as free wifi. Nice for free, but not if I had to pay for it. The lounge bfst is quite limited and as the main breakfast is a real treat you rather ""downgrade"" yourself. As with other reviews the main drawback is the wifi internet, it was impossible to connect and the very friendly staff acknowledged that due to high occupancy bandwith on the wifi suffers hugely. After seriously complaining, they installed a ""private"" wifi in my room and suddenly connection fast fast and reliable. Great service, but the problem stays, untill they invest in a better‚Ä¶"
4526,Sarita S,5,Excellent with just a minor drawback,"It is in great shape, everything looks at its best, clean and neat rooms and linens, nice designs and decoration.  Amazing variety at breakfast, impressive common areas and restaurants. You should make time and pamper yourself at the spa, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna are included in the room fee, additionally as massages or any other treatments have a fair price and the facilities are clean and beautiful, as for in rooms and in the spa amenities are great  As usual in India, personnel is amazingly kind and obliging, daily cleaning is done efficiently. One drawback very surprising for a hotel at this category: Internet is not included and even if you pay is not exactly average performance (I felt like using dial up) probably too many guests!!"
4527,angelmar73,4,"Nice stay, but i hate paying for internet service.","It was my second stay in it after some years, and the hotel is fantastic.  Chinese Restaurant and Italian Restaurant are excellent, with high quality food.  Breakfast is also good but the service in the morning is quite ... unexpected, as there are many waiters but all going up and down while your dirty plates are still in the table. Incredible that for such Price you are paying, they intend to charge you for internet service, with 24 hours for 12‚Ç¨...who stay connected 24 continuous hours??????????????????"
4528,MonsieurHarry,2,Awful choice for a business traveller,"Stayed here last week and had my stay ruined by a poor WiFi service.  The hotel and staff are good but the WiFi service was a joke.  If I was on holiday I would not have minded so much but when you are working, spending 30 minutes in the evening trying to log-on is no fun at all.  What is worse is when I complained they acknowledged how poor the service was rather than immediately going out and buying the equipment to fix it!  Three nights were ruined by a patchy and slow service.  This is simply not acceptable for a ""business hotel"".  As a result I will not stay here again.  The Sofitel and Lands End nearby looked quite nice when I went there for dinner, might try them."
4529,WomenOnWanderlust,5,Lovely ambiace & Service,"The hotel is truly 5 star ,I have stayed here during my business trip and the rooms are large and lighting is perfect,Big bathrooms and nice space to work as well. The food is lovely as well and have very good room service."
4530,worldtravellerLINY,5,Luxurious hotel near the airports,"The Grand Hyatt is very luxurious.  Amazing hotel with many great restaurants with nice, clean and well appointed rooms.  The service is very attentive as well.  However, the executive lounge was underwhelming.  The lounge is not worth the extra money.  The hotel transportation rates are outrageously exorbitant as well.  The spa was great and the rates reasonable.     The Grand Hyatt is not centrally located but it's close to both airports which makes it the perfect place to stay if you're just passing through Mumbai.   I've also stayed at the ITC Maratha near the airport but I would definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt again."
4531,Koreaninsingapore,4,Happening place,First time to Mumbai. Great familiarity in being able to stay in a Hyatt.  The hardware is good.  Very modern and everything works. Limousine pick up was flawless Breakfast in the restaurant was a good overview of Indian food.  When I stayed there was some major event going on in the hotel and saw a lot of beautiful people walking in and out of the lobby.  There was a wedding in the hotel and the corridors had people running around and quite noisy.   Other than that it was a good experience.  Would not hesitate to come back to a good solid Grand Hyatt Mumbai.
4532,R_Vimal,5,Very good customer responsivenss!,"I had previously stayed in the hotel in September as part of my business trip. However, I later found that I didn't get some of the supporting  bills from this trip and had mailed them in October for the same. Not only did I get an immediate response via email wherein i got the softcopy of the said bills, the next time I stayed there in october, I was specifically asked whether i required the hardcopy as well. The responsiveness really amazed me and the fact that they remembered about the same when I went the next time really added to the delight."
4533,Leroy_in,5,Good service,"We were at the Hyatt as we were doing business in India, we used their ball rooms for our event and the media rooms as well. I must say they are value for money and the staff lives up to an impecable mark. A great place to be at....they simply make things easier for you."
4534,Honeylene S,5,Hyatt ticks all the boxes,"Staying at Grand Hyatt one expects a high standard of accomodation and this Hyatt certainly lived up to that reputation. The rooms were excellent and very contemporary. The facilities in each room were great. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The costs, particularly in the restaurants (of which there are 3) was very reasonable. The shopping mall attached to the hotel, meant that last minute shopping could be easily done."
4535,RGBE,4,Business Trip,Stayed there on a business trip. A nice and huge property with a attached high end shopping mall.  Enjoyed the stay.. Breakfast has limited choice with less staff to serve .. otherwise happy with my stay.
4536,Mike W,5,Brilliant hotel,"A mate and I had a fantastic flashpacking experience in the Grand Hyatt. The price was incredible for what you get. The only slight issue was having to spend extra for Internet, but that extra also included buffet food and drinks, which is worthwhile.  The staff members were very friendly and would happily do anything to make your stay even better. "
4537,TravellingNoirin,4,Business trip - Aug '13,"I stayed here for 3 nights back in August while travelling with work.   The hotel staff were great - very welcoming, helpful and friendly.   Food: It was my first time in India and I didn't know what to expect with food. But the hotel offered great continental selections as well as plenty of opportunities to try local dishes.  The breakfast options were great and very tasty. Room service menu was very long with at least 4 different types of cuisines.  Again, pretty good as far as room services goes.  Room: amazing room and very spacious - mine was overlooking the inner courtyard. The bathroom was fab as well.  The room was spacious and well set up for working at night. internet was fast but the wireless was awful and unreliable."
4538,Noesurf,5,Tranquil and  luxurious,"Unless you are staying here in the middle of a major conference or wedding, it is one of the best business hotels in Mumbai. Great gym and pool area, comfortable rooms, pricy business center, great selection of restaurants, overpriced food and drinks, yet still keep going back."
4539,piarts_ontour,5,Ideal for Airport Transfer & Business Travel,"The airport is within 10 minutes drive from the international airport. Depending on traffic, it can take upto 30 minute to get across from the Hyatt to the domestic airport.  They are also building a new expressway overpass across from the hotel, so while the double glazed windows do a good job in keeping the noise out, the view outside is quite undesirable.   The bed, pillows and shower are the highlights of the room. The TV has limited English channels which was a notable downside if you want to unwide after a long flight by watching some premier league soccer.   The hotel gym is well equiped as far as hotel gym's go and it's available 24/7.   The breakfast buffet is comprehensive with a good spread of both western and local offerings.  Both domestic and international airport‚Ä¶"
4540,tanmayamar,4,Well Located and Meets Expectations,"I stayed overnight on a business visit and did not get to avail of many amenities at the hotel. However, the place does look grand, fitting for the name. Its not far from the airport and is a 10min drive from there during early morning/ late evening.  The staff could be a little more proactive in collecting your luggage from the cab and taking it up the stairs to the reception. The staff was otherwise polite and efficient.   The room was pretty nice, better than some of the peers in the industry. The cost was at par with similar hotels in the industry. Overall efficient and pretty good."
4541,Professionally9,1,Request for business,Senior management has no time to respond to requests.  It takes 18 calls and 2 messages to get a revert. Anyhow previous team of senior management was prompt and responsive. Responding to phone call is a professional approach.

4543,chennaihead,3,Mixed Bag,I visited this hotel to attend a business leadership summit last week. I had not made a reservation as it was a last minute decision to attend the same. I thought I shall get there and enquire the best rate for the day and book myself in. I was sure the hotel was not full and having been always a Taj guest I thought this maybe a welcome change . I enquired with the front desk and was shocked to hear the response. You will have to book this hotel through a travel agent???!! I was surprised. Wont a hotel direct reservation be better than a Travel agent who will change the hotel a commission. I am right there at your doorstep and you mean I will go to a travel agent somewhere in Mumbai with a hope to reserve a room there. Laughable.   The banqueting experience was good which is why‚Ä¶
4544,JeepNYC,4,Grand Hyatt lives up to the name,"Nothing makes you realise just how far Mumbai has come in the last 20 years than checking into the Grand Hyatt. It the same high vaulted ceilings, wide open spaces, peaceful air, attentive service and range of restaurants as its namesakes in other cities (for example, the Grand Hyatt Tokyo). Mumbai has become a powerful, international city of business and the Grand Hyatt Mumbai demonstrates the demand for world class service.  I've stayed here two or three times and you generally can't go wrong with the rooms (comfortable beds, superb bathrooms), facilities, or the quality of the breakfast dining at Five Five East -- I've never had the chance to eat dinner as I'm always arriving late and leaving early.

My previous experience with Hyatt was also great , it was during IPL at Kolkatta .we had great difficulty in getting room there but once we got booking they upgraded it to suits without extra charge ."
4547,ArvGangji,4,Average setting but excellent rooms,We have stayed at Grand Hyatt to celebrate New years and it was a great experience with fantastic new theme each year. The foyer does not have a warm feel as it does not have an area where you could sit and enjoy the beauty around with a coffee. It is also very uncomfortable that the foyer area does not have some luxurious seating to be seated whilst waiting for cab or a friend coming to see you. Rooms are generous size and definitely adds many stars to the property with fantastic shower/bath. It is the only property I had an experience of a customer service desk on the lobby of the floor giving it the edge over other properties. Good choice of restaurants to Dine.
4548,Abhay01,4,Grand Spa Experience ...,"The Grand Hyatt in Mumbai is in Kalina, very close to the Domestic Airport.   Stayed there in Sep & in Oct 2013, the rooms are nice, but the food at China House ... it was a great disappointment. I have eaten there in the past and had great meals, but my three trips in the last few months have been terrible - a big let down to a otherwise great hotel! China House is not consistent, how disappointing!  But the SPA .... EXCELLENT!! I had a Deep Tissue massage, and it was so good that  i went the next day for a Balinese Massage. EXCELLENT.  I think it was even better than the Park Hyatt! Having just returned a week before form a gruelling trek, this was just what I needed.  Other than the food being a great disappointment, staying here was a good experience!"
4549,tapoti,2,Poor Service,Stayed for 2 nights at the Grand Hyatt after a very long time. Since Taj Land's end was not available I had no choice but to stay here. It claims to be a 5 star hotel. But in reality it is a Five star hotel with a 2 star hotel service. You ask for a laundry pick up or order anything and it requires a minimum of 3 calls to follow up to get the service you want.
4550,tayalrahul,4,Average experience,"Hi All, I would like to share my experience of Grand hyatt stay. I stayed in Hyatt in September 2013 and everything was superb in Grand Hyatt except one thing which is hospitality. Grand Hyatt employee dosen't give you the respect as you are expecting from 7 start hotel. Servive quality, room facilities, Breakfast, Ambiance are awesome. I still would prefer to stay in Grand Hyatt."
4551,RajuSuneja,5,Nice stay ..!!,"I stayed here during Print-Week awards with colleagues for just one night, Its an awesome hotel. Great location, full of superb restaurants, bar, make you feel relax at the end of the day.  With its great offers & all other facilities it is not expensive at all, about 8000 INR per room, worth staying. 15 minutes from the airport almost 30 for Worli. Staff at front is too courteous. Breakfast was good enough. Going to stay here again for sure !!"
4552,PurnimaGG,4,Good stay,"It was a business trip and the location was just right... Just 15 mins from the domestic airport. Very friendly staff and they put me up on the floor for single women travellers - from a security point of view. Good room - though not much of a view - and the dressing area and bathroom was spacious. Loved the concept of ""forgotten anything? we'll get it for you"" - wherein the hotel offered to get you things like the nail cutter, nail paint remover.. (many more on the list) that one may have forgotten to carry and would need on the trip. Attentive staff - Good food. the ambience and food at the China Room was great! The breakfast was at the 55 East restaurant - which was 1 floor below the ground floor and a long flight of stairs.. with a bad knee - I found it difficult to climb up‚Ä¶"

4554,Lesandra,5,Worth all the 5 stars!,"Stayed here for 3 nights two weeks ago and we were blown away. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in the world but the LEVEL OF SERVICE at this one has exceeded them all. The rooms are excellent though slightly on the smaller side. The restaurants in the hotel are simply amazing, the chinese one takes the cake. The only thing that wasnt as good is the variety at the breakfast buffet. The people at the reception and concierge desk deserve 6 stars! I was down with the flu on the last day and I felt like the whole hotel was told to check up on me as they tried their best to make me feel better! Overall, excellent value for money. The Grand Hyatt, (and in particular a lady named Pooja) made our first stay in India a memorable one!"
4555,Kevindg9,4,Nice stay,"A good hotel if you have a business trip in Mumbai.  Even I never like the city, but when ever I go there, grand Hyatt always hotel I choose, as others not as nice, and tricky. Service nice, and easy to go to mall or meeting near by. "

4558,AnilKumarPorwal,4,Did not feel at home despite the luxury,"After landing in Mumbai on 22nd of October 2013 post 9pm, I reached Grand Hyatt within 15 minutes including the wait time and the drive time. After a thorough check I reached the reception where a room was already booked in my name by my host, a leading electronic security company for whose business conference, I was in the city. I reached the reception at half past nine, but was told to wait - rather very unceremoniously. I could very well feel the discrimination meted out to me as a brown skinned Asian in my own country. Another European who walked in after me was given total preference by the staff at the reception.  Almost 20 minutes later, when I was attended, they insisted to take a Security Deposit of INR 5000 even though my host had paid for the stay in advance. Despite‚Ä¶"

4560,Anand C,4,Not particularly good value for money.,"Stayed at this hotel in May for a conference. The hotel exterior seems to be in need of refurbishment. However, the interiors, (lobby, restaurants, conference halls, etc.), appear lavish and well maintained. Check-in at the front reception desk was a disappointment. They kept insisting on a cash deposit, inspite of photocopying my credit card. Overall the room was nothing much to write home about. Cannot comment on the room service, as I did not call for the same, during my stay. Breakfast at the coffee shop, was excellent, there was an extensive spread, and everything was tasty. Overall the stay was pleasant, but the attitude of the staff leaves something to be desired."
4561,ADS K,4,Everything is fine,"I stayed here for 4 nights, room is good, service is good, everything was fine typical business hotel with nothing personal service, for my entire stay it was nothing wow about anything, you get what you want... only thing i say where they need to improve is breakfast service, its very average. The food and atmosphere was really nice at the China garden restaurant, something of everyone to try if you are in Mumbai..."
4562,Dax C,5,Still the best,"Stayed at the hyatt in Mumbai for 5 nights in total( with a break of 3 night in oct ), still a great place  staff are so friendly, check in is quick, check out even faster, the indian Restaurant superb ( at a price of course ),the entire staff tries it's best to please or assist. Will be back in December again for sure. "
4563,Lpdds,3,"Showing its age, service below Trident/Taj standards, security good","This is a huge property but unfortunately showing its age and feels bit apathetic with regards to service.  My first room was a good corner room but a) there was a light in the a/c vent that I couldn't turn off, b) the doorbell from neighboring rooms was incredibly loud and woke me on few occasions. I moved to another room and was less bothered but sound proofing isn't great.  Few disappointments with the Club. Part of their package offer is use of the Board Room. However on multiple occasions asked to use and was told was reserved although I never saw anyone actually use it.  Security was tighter than I've seen in some other properties; something I prefer to see even it requires bit more time/effort.  All else good: restaurants, spa, gym."

I felt I am in my family."
4565,galliardo,4,Best large hotel I've stayed in.,"The rooms are really well designed - best showers, the staff are uniformly friendly, helpful which is remarkable in such a large hotel. The Chinese and Indian restaurants also really good. Nothing too much trouble for the concierage, cars always available for getting in and out of Mumbai. Main downside is location if you are planning to spend time downtown - its a between 40 - 70 minutes in a car. So it was great to get into the hotel quickly from  the airport but then I was spending two hours a day getting in and out of meetings downtown."
4566,saurabhvyas,4,Relaxing experience,"Good place to come back after hectic day at work and relax. Food is good (they give good attention to all their guests), and service is awesome!

4568,PPillay,5,Wonderful stay,"we stayed at this hotel twice in the same week: and i do not understand why this hotel is not in the Top 10 at Trip Advisor! The hotel itself is amazing, a real oasis in the bustling mumbai. The rooms are spacious and amenities more that sufficient. The breakfast buffet is an experience and absolutely divine! The service is another level! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay the Hyatt and will be back again and again and again. Some people have complained about the location - but traffic from anywhere in Mumbai is traumatic and at any time of the day. Thank you for a wonderful holiday!"
4569,SGtravelholic,3,Poor experience!,"My stay started on a bad note as the car transfer from the airport was late.  I had to wait over 10 minutes and then requested the person from the Hyatt Regency to call for the car.  The driver then showed up, it seems he had been relaxing nearby, while I waited.  The hotel location is not too far from the airport, but there is not much close by.  The Trident, Bandra Kurla is similar in terms of location but is a much better hotel.    The room layout is not the greatest and the breakfast below average by the standard of Indian hotels."

4571,Andrew M,4,Hyatt stopover en route to western India,"I had only one night here, and I am very pleased with the staff here at the Hyatt near the Mumbai airport. After a 15 hour flight, my check-in was smooth and well done. I travel frequently to Mumbai and this is the first time here. I tried this hotel because I was not happy with other places I have slept at in Mumbai. The staff is very accommodating. The only thing I  would ask for is better internet speed."
4572,BatWillow68,5,Everything you expect from Grand Hyatt,"The Hotel is only 15 minutes from the airport but it was also not too far from the city.  We had a sightseeing tour the next day and saw everything in the city we wanted to see in a day easily without too much hassle. There is not much else to say a fabulous hotel and although I have not stayed anywhere else in Mumbai, I would not look elsewhere.  Breakfast buffet to die for and the China Lounge bar come nightclub was very lively on the Friday night until 3.00 am."
4573,stalin_peace,5,Pleasant stay in Grand Hyatt Mumbai,It was a very pleasant stay in Grand Hyatt Mumbai. Located close to the airport yet not in a crowded place. People in the business centre were very courteous. They could have avoided the seat of the care taker of the business centre very close to room number 1169.
4574,Faiz1901,4,Always good!,I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt on business multiple times and every single time the service is consistent and of high standard.  the location works for me as its very close to the domestic airport and you can cover the distance in less than 20 minutes in non peak hours.  The rooms are fairly large and well appointed.   For me the best part of staying at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai is the food. The buffet spreads are very very nice and for people who enjoy multiple cuisines their buffets are not to be missed.  All in all a very good hotel which meets all requirements of a modern day traveller.
4575,AgarwalYash,4,Good Hotel,"I stayed there for almost 20 days over 3 months. Its a good hotel with good food. The rooms are not too interesting though. The hotel is made as a convention hotel with one of the largest banquet halls. Expecting such a hotel with no door locks for the in room toilets leave no room for sharing it with anybody, unless a couple staying in. The in room toilets were a put-off."

Rooms are very nice, internet connection is fast and Club team is very nice and professional. I think that Mumbai Grand Hyatt crew is one of the most friendly crew I have ever met in Hyatt hotels. Breakfast buffet in the club is not so big but they have ""a la carte"" menu as well. Very close to the airport"

So someone is obviously is not checking cords   The next day my check in was still not showing and frantic calls were made to my travel agent telling them I was a no show.

I saw several meetings held at the hotel, so it could serve as a base for your stay in Mumbai (which can be daunting, if not interesting for the traffic). I'll definitely stay here next time.  The room was clean and well maintained. It is not your usual room though, in terms of layout (although I stayed at the Club Room which should explain the uniqueness of the layout). The bathroom can open up into the room, and the room was extra spacious.   What I also noticed very quickly is that the hotel smelled very nice! The hallways smelled pleasant and the room too had its own sweet smell.   Breakfast was good enough, although I wished they‚Ä¶"
4584,Amy L,5,Always Feel at home,"My husband has regularly stayed in Grand Hyatt for a few days in a month during the past year. This is my second visit with him and we have always felt at home on the club floor. We love the service and the staff there. They are always very professional, pleasant and friendly.  I have the privilege to meet with two very fine young men from housekeeping both times. I am very impressed with the attitude and the attentiveness of Pratik during this stay.  He has taken service to his heart and provide us with service beyond our expectation.  I don't think it is happy co-incidence that we have encountered such consistent high quality service standard. We would like to congratulate and thank the Hotel for giving us a consistent comfortable stay here."
4585,AlokVerma76,1,Arrogant service,"I stayed at this hotel for a night and it seems that Hotel became very arrogant in behaviour. I had organised an event for my company, so i had booked a banquet hall, a conference room in business centre and 2 rooms. Overall experience was really bad."
4586,Nikhil U,5,Excellent,"A real value for money. The hotel was a real good bargain for the price paid.  Everything was as described, and far better than expected. Would prefer to use Cleartrip again. It was a pleasure.  Most recommended.         "
4587,Long M,4,Service - always trying to please,"Nice room design. Best to get the room facing the inner court yard. Better view compared to the other side's view.  Good bed, and a very nice restroom.  What impresses me is the staff. Always trying their level best to please the guests."
4588,Mike_G_Aeronaut,5,I always look forward to the Grand Hyatt.,"I love the Grand Hyatt Mumbai. I always look forward to layovers here for a couple reasons. I'll keep it short:  Great Staff - Very helpful, personal, polite and attentive to all your needs,  Ultra modern hotel - Lobby is like an art gallery. Beautiful Rooms - Comfortable, quiet, clean and relaxing. Room Service - Great food, extensive menu. Real hamburgers, steaks and fish. China House Bar - Nice club, enjoy a beer or a drink without leaving the comfort of the hotel. Breakfast buffet - Two words: Eggs Benedict. Best in India! 10 mins from the airport. Well worth it!"

It was extremely comfortable, clean and big. Only managed to have breakfast at the hotel which was absolutely lovely! Highly recommended for all kinds of travelers."
4591,RNSANE,4,The Club Level is Well Worth the Splurge,"Until my retirement ( and massive decrease in my income ) four years ago, Hyatt Hotels were one of my top vacation and business choices.  Much to my surprise, when looking at my Gold Passport account last week, I realized I still have some Hyatt points left.  Midway in my six month Mumbai stay, I decided to treat myself to a night at the Grand Hyatt.  I had enough points for the Club Level which was an incredible bit of luck!  This property is so lovely and the staff are amazing -, from those that greeted me at the front door to the folks at reception and the concierge lounge.  Actually, as I finished registering, Shirley Martins, guest services executive, looking like a Bollywood movie star, was waiting to escort me to my room.  The huge space, lovely marble bathroom, a bouquet‚Ä¶"
4592,ArunRS,3,nothing  'grand' about it,"while proximity to airport and decent room/bathroom amenities were pluses, most other aspects were disappointing. the staff seemed quite indifferent, both at the reception as well as in the dining area. the breakfast spread at celini was unimpressive and the food served in the banquet hall was barely average. almost nothing that lingers on you or makes you wanna come again, once you leave the hotel premises!"
4593,UjjalBhakat,4,Nice elegant venue for business meeting,Stayed for 3 nights during a medical conference. Nice rooms. Excellent service. Bar opens 3 pm. Meanwhile the Lobby Lounge is there for your need. Mini bar is in room. Complimentary freash fruits in room. Will get a replacement daily. Other standard services. Wifi is chargable.
4594,unni_menon,4,Airport proximity and spacious room,"The fact that its just a short drive from the airport (esp. when one is landing in at midnite after a long work day), is a major advantage. The club room was large and spacious. very contemporary feel to the room, with a large bath and a walk in wardrobe. the opening onto the terrace garden added a great deal. Room service (even at a late hour) was very efficient. The breakfast had a solid global flavour, with a wide variety, but can be really crowded.  Not too happy about (i) breakfast not being included (ii) wifi had to be separately paid for ???  even a small highway inn throws this in complimentary these days (iii) the Bathroom is designed typically a couple staying in the room. its largely open with an option to draw in screens (without lock) not for a proper shut, in case‚Ä¶"

4600,61asif,4,One of the better business hotels in Mumbai,"Have been regularly staying in the hotel for past couple of years. Hotel has an almost hassle-free 'check-in' and 'check-out' process. Have never waited for more than 5 minutes during the process.  Hotel rooms have all the necessary features required for a business traveller. There have been numerous instances of me extending my one-day trip to Mumbai by a day or so. One of the few hotels in Mumbai where you have to not specifically ask for a dental or shaving kit. These are minor things but go a long way in giving comfort to its customer.  Will always recommed this hotel for business stay,"

Travel times to central & south Mumbai are 30-90 mins depending upon traffic.  Hotel decor bland international style, restaurants also lack character but provide very familiar fare for North American business travellers. Leisure facilities are standard for a large hotel.  Irritations include high price of Wifi at 900 rupees per day, at times the service is intermittent or very slow plus extortionate prices to use printers etc in the business centre and club lounge. Surely this should be free.  Take care with billing, extra charges can creep on the bill. Be very clear on your room rate and any additional negotiated‚Ä¶"

Hotels closer to the venue offer discounted room rates for international visitors. The rooms need to be booked well in advance. Every year we get booked into different hotels. This year it was the Grand hyatt mumbai. The booking was made in the name of the company. Arrived at the reception and was told I need a credit card so they could block 35,000 Rs (close to 500 USD) for incidental expenses. The company was bearing my expenses during the stay, and I explained the same to the reception guys but he was adamant. So paid with the card. Rooms are average sized. Pretty clean.

While check in they asked my Credit card, which I refused, as the complete arrangements were made by our company. Then they asked me to deposit Rs 20000 (refundable). I refused that too and contacted my employers. The thing was clarified only the next day. I didnt expect this from the hotel. Apart from this, room was nice and spacious. Restaurants were good. I especially like the basement restaurant. Sea food was amazing. Breakfast too was good, with a variety of food. Really nice."

I agree with another review I read here that the rooms, facilities and the exterior in particular have not been well maintained.This trip, I dined at both the basement restaurant and the Indian restaurant, and the furnishings in both just seemed tired and worn. The food in the downstairs restaurant was average, and in the Indian restaurant, it was fine but overpriced. My experience with the staff throughout the hotel was excellent; everyone I had contact with was extremely professional and helpful. However, as on my first stay here, they continue to be quite lax at refilling the minibar.

4608,austinmike1979,3,Former glory,"this was my second stay at this hotel, and while 4-5 years ago it was truly and icon with some of the best restaurants and service in town, things have changed. First of all, the hotel isn't anywhere nearly as well maintained as it used to be. The quality of food and celini is still as good, but service is mediocre. The grand club which was the highlight of the Grand Hyatt Mumbai experience is nowhere nearly as good in terms of service or food offering. I can't help but think that the management is penny pinching and letting service standards go of a once great hotel in this part of Mumbai."
4609,Soko11,4,Great hotel,Stayed at the grand hyatt Mumbai for 2 nights while attending a conference. This is a great hotel has a grand luxurious feel. The rooms are large and well laid out. Plenty of options for charging and connecting electronic devices. No plug points next to the bed though unless you un plug one of the lamps. Wonderful high water pressure in the showers.  Various restaurant options for meals each one was excellent.  Breakfast time was chaotic and the staff at the restaurant could barely keep up. But did so with a smile. The location is conveniently central to the nightlife in bandra to the business hub BKC or hop onto the sea link if your work takes you to south Mumbai.  
4610,dcb23,4,Business Hotel,"Located in Santacruz, this hotel was very convenient to travel for business to BKC unlike other hotels located in south mumbai which are far-off. The staff of the hotel was really cordial, sweet and nice. Customer service is really their priority. But, I think it is more of a business hotel than a luxury hotel where you can be with your family. But one of my closest friends is a very big fan of this hotel as it is near the airport and come what may, she always puts up in hotel when she is in Mumbai."
4611,Sooki2013,5,Company conference,Fab hotel! Excellent service and facilities ...... Been again and would def go again :) Very conveniently located too..... Close by to airport Didn't get chance to check out spa as was on business..... But will be going sometime soon on further business so will make the time to check it out! Great night life too Rooms very clean and love the way the bathroom is set!

Staff are incredibly friendly and simply cannot do enough for you. My driver Ravi really went above and beyond to help me find some of the items and presents i wanted to buy in Mumbai - this is the kind of service that really ensures I will come back again to this hotel.  I had long flight delay and they extended my room for me until late and gave me free access to the spa facilities afterward. Food from each restaurant is excellent, the rooms are very clean, spacious and comfortable.  Really cannot praise this hotel enough, really does great benefit to the Hyatt brand."
4613,jeyraman_p,1,Service was bad,"I stayed in grand hyatt on 3 occasions. They are not polite, conceirge desk dont know proper information and some problem with cleanliness of room. I met the manager and reported all the points and hope action is taken next time when am there."

The restaurants are of a good standard however the Chinese restaurant blows the rest out of the water. The gym was really good for being a hotel gym, however don't go when one of the senior staff possibly the manager are having their personal training. The gym was hogged for 30 minutes!

4617,Krishnan Iyer S,4,Just Right,"First time at the Grand Hyatt, liked it despite an incident in the middle of the night when the aircon in the room started making a lot of noise (however the problem was fixed within minutes of my complaint). If you are juggling between meetings in South Bombay and BKC, plus Parel/Worli thrown in - I would highly recommend this place. The staff is very courteous, the girls at the front desk are friendly and professional, they have a good breakfast, and importantly suited for the business traveler (no loud tourists, no bawling kids...). It probably is the cheapest when compared to say a Trident (BKC), Taj Lands End and the Sofitel. Very impressed with the room as well, and the range of toiletries. I have noted to stay here on my routine trips to Mumbai. "

We upgraded to the Club Floor which was excellent value. Their cocktail hour was from 6.00pm for 2 hours and almost every night, we ate the substantial canopes and sipped on wine (including sparkling wine!) and skipped dinner - we didn't need to eat much in the heat. In addition, throughout the day, you could take soft drinks from the Club Lounge - so there was never a worry about being ripped off by the hotel when all you want to do is keep hydrated.

Why should one stay at the Grand Hyatt: - Its away from the busy streets - It is clearly meant for the business traveller  Why should one not stay at the Grand Hyatt: - Its away from the busy streets - It is clearly meant for the business traveller  The rooms are clean and the service is at par with any of the other 5-star hotels.   - I liked the way the ladies at the reception make you feel welcome.  - I was not impressed with the food  - There was‚Ä¶"

The quality of service, food , the room was all very good. The location is just perfect for a quick trip as it is 10 minutes drive to the airport. I enjoyed the breakfast which was more like brunch. Although, it is on the costlier side for food it is worth the dime."
4621,GOAL_Spring,5,Different Experience,"This is the second time I am doing a review for this hotel.  I stayed two weeks in a row.  The experience this time was very different. The following summarizes it:  - The hotel not only provides complimentary car pick-ups to and forth the airport, they also provide complimentary car service to and forth the nearby business area.  During pick-ups, they took the my number (even though it was an international number) and call me when the car arrived. The drivers were all polite. In one instance, the driver waited for more than 30 min without any complaint - The staff throughout the reception, concierge, bell counter were all attentative and friendly, very eager to help  - The hotel has a single lady program in which they assign lady guests in nearby rooms.

I also had room service food which was some fo the ebst I have eaten.  The gym is great as is the pool.  The location near the airport is reason why lots of people choose the hotel, although it it is then quite  way to south Mumbai.  The niggles - the lobby is overwhelming - not at all welcoming.

I have stayed previously in 2009, so knowing the restaurants are very good and get busy, I pre-booked the Indian, Chinese and Italian restaurants, last night we tried the Indian food restaurant and it was again excellent, tonight the Chinese with similar expectations.

4626,ShaunN,5,Impeccable service!,"Stayed 4 nights in June for a business trip at Grand Hyatt Mumbai.   The hotel's crisp modern architecture is matched with a high level of service that is difficult to properly describe. From doormen, to checkin staff, waiters in restaurants to cleaning staff, everyone seems to know your name, and be ready to assist.    The room was fantastic, well appointed with modern touches including an innovative wet-room shower/bath area.    Food in all restaurants was amazing, with service to match.   Only slight gripe was the exorbitant charge for hotel laundry.    If you're heading to Mumbai on business, you should really consider staying here."

The restaurants were excellent, especially the China House as well as the Italian and Indian restaurants on premises (plenty of choices).  There is a gourmet food shop on the lower level where you can enjoy a cappucino, as well as imported packaged foods such as French cookies, Swiss chocolates, Italian mozzarella/prosciutto, packaged cereals and milk, French yogurt and a bakery.  The spa and pool area is also very nice.  Transportation to business meetings is easily arranged by the concierge as well as a day‚Ä¶"
4631,KGB777,3,Too much neighbour noise on too many occasions,"I've stayed here on numerous occasions now but I've now decided to stay in other places. Generally my main criticism is the noise insulation: the design of the doors mean that there is considerable noise when they close. Plus if you're not on the top floor you seem to get strange noises from rooms above. Then there is the aircraft noise on top.  Rooms are usual Hyatt standard and are decent enough, although I feel they are also ageing a little and could do with a re-furb.  Good selection of restaurants: the Chinese restaurant in particular is excellent.  Breakfast here is also good."
4632,LJ_Surrey,4,"Good service, excellent food but poor sound proofing in bedroom","Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights on business and thought the staff & catering were very good, definitely recommend China House for dinner (bellini & peking duck were amazing). The Pool & spa facilities were also good if you get the chance to use them. The only fault to the hotel is the poor soundproofing of the bedrooms, it was a common comment from my colleagues who also had broken sleep during their stay so maybe a hotel to avoid if your a light sleeper."

Everything, starting from check-in, in-room services, restaurant, food quality and check-out processes were very good.

The hotel is spread over large area and provides a general sense of calm and serenity. The hotel staff members are generally good, but I did notice that in the corridor or lobby they just pass by and do not greet the guest.

I think I can sum it up with the subject above: If you want to escape from India while being in India, this is the place to stay. There is very little to tell you that you are in India, except for the staff and the artwork. I mean this in all aspects - that can be good or bad, depending on your perspective - or mixed as I felt. It's totally secluded and entering feels like a border crossing - you can't walk outside and walk down an actual city or neighborhood street.   Let me start with the obvious: It is a gorgeous hotel and the rooms are totally excellent.

We had to attend a wedding function at the Hyatt, and the food, hall, service etc was amazing. Surprisingly the food was really good!  An injury in the group, we required a doctor and medicines - the hotel was prompt and helpful, this felt nice.  The external walls need to be maintained however, the plaster was seen coming out when we were chilling in the balcony.  Location is not too great, but if you wish to visit the suburbs and the city then this is a good place to stay for a couple of days."
4639,Mohammed F,4,Nice Place to Stay,"The Hyatt is brilliant and a great place to stay. My opinion of the Grand Hyatt is NOT very great. I think the reason for this is I stayed at the Hyatt Regency before I stayed here. The regency is far better than the grand.  That said, rating this hotel without comparing it to the regency - I would say that the room size was okay (NOT too great). The bathroom was nice and lovely. I have to to say that they do have a lovely bed and a big tv.  The breakfast was nice and the service was good. I still feel they have so much more they can do.The lobby is large and lovely, the hotel is so nicely built. Its a great place to go to with friends."
4640,Upat71,4,Excellent hotel,"Great location, close to airport. The rooms are very nice, clean and comfortable. The hotel staff was very efficient and friendly. Extremely helpful . The restaurants are excellent. The choice in food and quality was very good."
4641,mylanHyderabad,5,stay at hyatt for a conference,"Its great experience staying there. Excellent rooms, staff service is outstanding. I stayed for two nights to attend a conference. This is my first visit to this hotel.i preferred to visit again. Close to airport, commuting not a issue at all."
4642,Hitesh H,3,Nothing woow,Hotel was as per haytt standard good.but the location was sad and nothing interesting around hotel sides.over all it did not give any happy feeling stepping in.hotel transfers are highly expensive in a ok car.if you are a leisure traveler its not a hotel to look for.
4643,Saurabhkedia,4,Nice hotel!,"Had stayed for a conference. Its a lavish hotel. Rooms were very nice. Same as hyatt regency chennai, with the bathrooms and rooms coming together. Food was good. Service good. However, I feel the hotel layout could have been little better. Has some award winning restaurants. Must try! Overall a good hotel!"
4644,Nirmalsinh R,5,Good hotel for longer stay,I had chance to attend a marriage function at grand. well managed well organised and well VIP crowd control. Well managed food service for more  than 3000 people approximately at a time without any service problem.timely filling on every counter was remarkable.It was a grand success. Even every corner was taken care without disturbing other guest.I suggest this hotel for your big function.
4645,Dsareen,3,Good place to hold a Business meeting close to the Airport,"The Grand Hyatt is a 10 min drive from the Airport and a very convenient place to conduct a business meeting, if in Mumbai for a short trip and don't want to spend hours in traffic. The rooms are neat, contemporary design and comfortable. OK for a business trip but avoid if traveling on leisure with family. Prices are high for what is basically an Airport hotel and food prices exorbitant, with breakfast being over Rs.1000 (with tax). Large lobby, with lots of places to sit and have meetings. Otherwise a dull interior, with large, poorly lit spaces in the evenings and restaurants with little or no views. The exterior of the Hotel needs urgent attention, with peeling paint and plaster."
4646,CharuJ,3,"Good, can get better","I stayed in Hyatt for an official trip. The hotel is beautifully decorated and maintained with very helpful staff. However, for a 8k per night room, no breakfast and wifi is quite a bummer. Also, the rooms feel a little stuffy and very corporate."
4647,pandalf,4,Fine hotel that ticks all the boxes,"I stayed at the Hyatt because my company was organising a conference there. It is an excellent hotel with well appointed bedrooms and great facilities. We ate at two of the many restaurants, and both were very good. As with many other Mumbai hotels, there is little else to do in the vicinity, but the surrounding neighbourhood is reasonably presentable and felt safe. "
4648,OrcaStockholm,4,Elegant Luxury,"An isle of elegant luxury surrounded by a wall of poverty, chaos and filth. The hotel standard concerning cleanliness, courtiouness, prompt service etc was beyond reproach. The breakfast embraced tastes of all nationalities making you feel personally pampered at every turn. The Italian restaurant under Alessandro Persico served the best pizzas and stuffed cannellonis we ever experienced. A word of warning: do not occupy rooms facing the hotel front as you will be constantly annoyed by honking of traffic outside. Interior rooms facing the pool will assure you the peace necessary to enjoy your stay. All in all, exept for the hotel¬¥s location, it is to be highly recommended."
4649,sparsh g,4,Best Hospitality ever experienced,"One cannot get better services than this hotel. starting from early check in till my stay everything was extremely smooth. On early arrival, they allotted us room which was very appreciating. The breakfast was lavishly spread and fresh and quality uncompromised. I loved it!!!! They gave me two breakfasts on one night check in. Bathroom was nice. The dinner I ordered as in room dining was an amazing experience as the table set up they have and quality is amazing but an expensive one. They didnt allow late check out but gave me spa voucher wherein I could have shower, steam, sauna etc to get fresh when I come back to collect luggage. I felt that was fair enough.   Some drawbacks not to be highlighted much.   Check out took time due to which I got delayed to the place I was going.‚Ä¶"
4650,sumitkhetan,5,Back Home ....away from Home,"This time I am here on vacation with family and friends enroute to Lavasa and other places. Stayed one night at this most beautiful hotel, where the services at all level are just can't be compared. The Club Lounge is the perfect place for meeting besides relaxation  / unwind / entertainment at evening hours. I just love every thing about this hotel....this is the only hotel where I stay when i am in Mumbai...."
4651,jenabaintheworld,5,still the best business hotel in Mumbai,"Very convenient at 10 min from domestic airport and 15 min from BKC business area.   Time to international airport really depends on time of day -- best to verify.     Checkin/checkout is getting better--- more efficient and friendly, and they finally ask if you prefer credit card payment in INR or home currency.    The rooms are very clean, comfortable and well appointed, with a very comfy bed/pillow and nice bathroom.    Quiet rooms--- esp those facing the interior court that also have a nicer view.    Breakfast buffet and wifi are included, and the buffet offers excellent choice and quality food."
4652,Rakhmatullaev L,5,Perfect,"Good place to stay, but security checking is annoying. Also they charged me for mini bar, but I didnt drink anything, however they have rechecked and apologised. Breakfast is excellant, perfect and friendly staff. Recommend!!!!"
4653,OCProfessor,5,"Great, but not for me","The Grand Hyatt is a wonderful hotel, still there is a coldness about it that didn't appeal to us,  The public areas are cavernous and the room furnishings a sort of up-scale Ikea: stark and modern.  Given that it's Mumbai you have to have your bags checked each time you go in and out, and five guards check your car (and under it) when going in.  Not the hotel's fault, of course."
4654,Mir Amer H,4,Good service and good food,Hotel is closer to the upcoming business district BKC of Mumbai and therefore is conveninent from travel perspective. It doesn't have great view etc. but then has good restaurants and China House which is a great place to unwind.   Leave early for airport or ask at the front desk about travel time since in Mumbai it is dependent on which part of the day one is travelling  The food is good and courteous and helpful staff.
4655,abeb1900,5,Great Location,"I chose this hotel due to its proximity to the airport, and both the pick-up from the domestic airport and the drop-off to the international airport were done in record time. All the staff were friendly and ready to serve. During my stay I had a lot of meetings and hosted a lunch, and all went smoothly."
4656,Richard C,5,Service beyond expectations,"I travel a significant amount on business but this was my first ever visit to India. I had no pre-conceptions of the Grand Hyatt but to say that I was overwhelmed by the service, the courtesy, the food and the accommodation would be an understatement. The check-in process was painless and swift and my room on 4th floor was spacious and very comfortable  -  the walk in shower was a big plus.  Every engagement with FOH staff brought a smile and the utmost courtesy  -  exemplary.  Albeit, the hotel is not in an area where one would typically go out for a walk for dinner of an evening, the fact that there is Soma - an award winning restaurant serving Indian cuisine - is more than adequate compensation. Vinod Rana, the Chef de Cuisine, is rightly proud of his team and their skills. I‚Ä¶"

As others have commented, it is close to the airport, so some distance from the tourist attractions such as the Gateway, but if you are looking for total luxury, lovely, helpful staff and outstanding food then this is the place for either business or holiday.

Stunning architecture, beautifully decorated, modern fittings & fixtures around hotel with all sort of luxury, tight security - ya, that's Grand Hyatt i'm talking about here in Mumbai. It is indeed a great grand experience I ever had in Mumbai. Hotel is simply superb and service is top notch but little away from the main hustle & bustle of Mumbai life. It must be mentioned that, hotel is close to airport but away from the action zone like food shop, malls, beach etc. Undoubtedly, Hyatt has everything inside to allure one to stay again and again. Rooms are too big and toilet is almost 70% of the room size having plenty of toiletries, various sizes of towels, sandal and gown.

Our last stop was Mumbai and we decided to go with a luxury hotel. We were not the ""typical"" guests that stayed at the Grand Hyatt - we took the first ringy ding taxi we found, 4 in what seemed to be a clown car, and were dusty from the road. I guess it wasn't what they wanted to see come through their doors and we were escorted away from the main check in while they processed us. They seem to cater more to business travelers and not necessarily guests exploring Mumbai. There were times we would go to the front desk to ask for recommendations and they would go over us and assist other guests.

4662,NS_chd,3,Certain odd things for a '5 star' brand,"I stayed here for 2 nights on business. One of the very odd things is the design of the room especially the bathroom. If two people who are not husband/wife have to share such a room, it is not just impossible for one to use even the handwash basin if the other is taking bath or even the lavatory but even open the closet meant for hanging clothes, in-room safe or the ironing board. Maybe it is designed only for solos or couples. The second odd thing is that during buffet breakfast, you cannot put in cut fruit by yourself into your plate. There is a person standing there on duty and you have to indicate what fruit you want and what quantity. I have never seen such an arrangement in any hotel of this level either within India or abroad. Third thing, you cannot go from your room to‚Ä¶"
4663,rsinghabout,4,Excellent but not tip top,"My second stay here, in April 2013. The decor is quite spectacular, with beautiful and thought-provoking art and sculpture. The food in 55 East is great; the bar is good; the staff in the bars/restaurants are all excellent.  The rooms are absolutely fine, and you'll want for nothing.  However the overall service experience is not in the same league as Indian 5* hotels like Trident and the Taj.  The Trident Bandra Kurla is not far from here but in a different league.  Check in and check out was painfully slow.  Printing 2 pages out in the business centre turned into a protracted experience as the staff insisted I sign to pay for it.  That wouldn't happen at the Trident or Taj.  Small things make a big difference."
4664,Taka P,5,The grandeur of the Hyatt,"The name itself is self explanatory.Every thing here is grand ,right from the gates to the room, unfortunately so are the rates.The staff are friendly without being familiar and throughout professional. The rooms are big and beautiful and totally ultra modern,which somehow justifies the money paid for it. The bathrooms are purely luxurious ,and well stocked and has everything you can think of and expect in a 5 Star Hotel,and then some. .They have thought about everything and provided accordingly.The room service is excellent and so is the food.But what I liked the most is the breakfast buffet complete with all sorts of breakfast items and beverages.Its simply divine , especially the vast range of cakes and buns.Chinese, oriental,Mexican ,Indian,South Indian,Danish ,,,you name it‚Ä¶"

Service is good but some scope of improvement is there. Buffer spread is very good. Room decor is very chic. However they lack flexibility. Even being 5 Star though, it lacks some flexibility. Laundry service is not 24*7 to my dismay which is essential for business traveller. It is a large, modern hotel. Try to stay not very far off from the elevators as it is a long walk. However the view from the hotel room is average to poor. There is no great view of city; Inside view also is average. Don't expect a room with a great view."

In fact we only discovered the huge high end shopping on the ground floor when we got lost looking for the swimming pool. We also got lost looking for our room coming back from the swimming pool. On arrival the check in was extremely smooth. We asked if it was possible to have a room with a balcony and the staff went out of their way to find us one.

I have never actually someone great someone else by wishing them a great day, but I did here. I visited the gym and although, not the most fully fitted, I still loved it because of the attention.

From the moment you arrive and checkin (which for me was at 01:45 on Sunday morning) the staff are friendly, courteous, and go out of their way to ensure your stay is comfortable and unencumbered.  The gym is open 24/7 and large enough to complete any number of workouts - the pool area is a quiet retreat for a Sunday afternoon refresh.  The food is quite consistent and worthy of the Grand Hyatt name.  All-in-all definitely the hotel of choice on my next trip."

However, the hors d'oeuvres were of a great standard and I loved the middle eastern food served at the starters collection. The brown pita bread with hummus (chick-pea dip), baba ghanoush (egg-plant dip), Muhammara (red pepper/walnut dip) and other condiments and salads were just out of this world. The rest of the dinner consisted of kebabs, shawarma, and other typical Indian curries with rice. Desserts were just delightful with some real nice ethnic Indian dishes."

Restaurant staff was attentive, knowledgeable and help ful. Internet was slow initially,Later it was better.internet speed should  improve. Only negative thing was Security officials were very unfriendly, and think too much of presence all over the hotel. We were not used to this. We recommend to stay in this hotel. Will definitely come back to this hotel."

Outside view is the only factor that could not excite you if you are on a leisure trip, it did not matter me as I was on a business trip. FOOD: Great variety of food. I loved the pizza, very well made. Bit on a pricy side. Breakfast is decent as well. LOCATION:  Great if you have work in the suburbs of Mumbai and anywhere near BKC, airport.

The technicians did repair the AC and it got down a little cooler, but 70 F is not cold enough for me!  But it was livable.  The lobby is gorgeous and the dining areas very clean.

I woke up at 9am feeling refreshed and ready to go.  The breakfast is quite a site and offers a wide range to cater for all tastes. The staff were excellent at all times but not overpowering which can happen in India.   I had dinner at the Italian restaurant one even and had one of the best meals I had this year.

So I immediatly went to the reception and I told those people about the situation, requested them to allow me to make a call. I was shocked by their response, as they denied saying I could not make calls from there, I have to do it from my room. They did not even bother to help me at that time. None of them help me over there. I had to rush to my room to call the customer support of the cab so that they could inform the Cab driver to return the mobile. Fortunatly the Cab(Meru) support team‚Ä¶"

4698,rachelannmorris,5,Bombay Sapphire - A Great Hotel,"Note to self...when booking a hotel in India, always ask if there is a wedding in house. This hotel is huge, more than 500 rooms. It seemed that every single nook and cranny of the hotel was taken up the weekend I stayed with a million dollar wedding.  This impacted in small ways...the lobby was loud and boisterous most times and on a personal and selfish level, it meant as a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member, I wasn't able to be upgraded to a bigger room as is the practice.  But, those are essentially white girl problems.The Hyatts in India are among my favorite, the rooms are always well appointed, staff unfailingly polite and well trained and the dining outlets superb. This hotel is no exception.  Despite the ""train station"" feel of the lobby, the rooms are quiet. On check‚Ä¶"
4699,aayusef,4,trip to India,"over all the hotel is good ,but if the breakfast is included in the room rate will be much better ,as the room rate is too expensive .also if the remaining given by hard currency not local currency will ease the check out process , no point of having local currency while leaving the country ."
4700,Oyster_king007,4,Just off Western Express higway and close to Domestic airport !!,"The location is great just close to the domestic airport  and just off the western express highway . Stayed there for 1 night prompt check in , it is a long walk to the rooms as it is a big hotel .  Rooms are big and bathrooms are chic . Options of fine dinning Indian -Chinese etc are on Lobby level along with  the Bar , the atmosphere is vibrant . Food is good  and service is perfect .  Was late for breakfast so could not enjoy it maybe next time , it is Grand Hyatt ."
4701,Rohitthar12,4,Great business Hotel!!!,Was at the grand hyatt in mumbai a week back. the hotel was great except for the approach road which seemed awful. the check-in was quick and the rooms well appointed. the prices for food etc seemed in line with most five star properties in the city. the only thing i found strange was that this seems one of the only few hotels i've been to where they charge exorbitant amounts for internet access. it costs abt 400 INR per hour that seems rather excessive.  great place otherwise will recommend
4702,Srini,1,Stay away if you want a good night's sleep,"I am regular guest at the Grand Hyatt! Today when I returned to the hotel after a long day of meetings I couldn't sleep because of loud music from a party downstairs.   When I complained (at midnight) that the music was disturbing my sleep I was told that it would go on for another hour or so.  So the hotel is more intent on pleasing its event commitments rather than its weary travelers! Very callous attitude in the responses too, this despite being a platinum gold passport member.  So if you are looking for sleep after a hard day, this hotel is not for you! Stay away!"
4703,taruny,4,good hotel,This hotel is located near to domestic airport . The welcome was warm with checkin process bit slow . The rooms are small but ambience is good . The food is good . The concierge is good and very helpful . I would rate this hotel bit expensive .
4704,Kiran S,5,A great place to stay and will recommend to all,"It was a short stay, as was a connection place for onward travel to London. I've never busted Mumbai so wasn't sure about the location ( from address states off Express Highway). But once your in the hotel you don't hear a sound off the busy Indian roads.  Sitting outside by poolside even there is no disturbance of noises off the street. Hotel is absolutely fabulous as you will find everything you need from various cuisine restaurants to designer shopping in the indoor hotel plaza. We picked up some gifts and souvenirs from the shops which I presume are leased as they are not Hyatt shops.  You will of course end up spending 3 times or more than what you would for goods inside the hotel. But we decided to stay in the hotel and enjoy a relaxing retreat away from busy India. You‚Ä¶"
4705,WordTraveller007,3,Hotel with a problem with Mosquitos,"After staying here last year for 1 night for a quick stopover, I thought I would book the same hotel again for 1 night stopover between flights. The hotel has had some refurb and it looks nice and the reception staff are well trained and helpful.  The main problem the hotel is experiencing at the moment is the mosquitoes, the main lobby was full of them and also the rooms. The staff were walking around with electrical tennis rackets trying to kill as many as it could. Even when I checked out the reception asked me if everything was ok, I advised them with the problems with the mosquitos and she didn‚Äôt say much as she was flicking them away whilst speaking to me.  Overall a good hotel but they need to sort the mosquitos out!"

4707,Road_Warrior_Foodie,5,Top notch in every way,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for nearly a week on a business trip. I had a club room and access to the executive lounge. The hotel staff, from housekeeping to check-in desk to the lounge were fantastic. The lounge is comfortable, has an acceptable breakfast and is an excellent place to hold meeting. If there was a drawback for me, it was location. the Grand Hyatt is not far from the airport, but most of my meetings ended up being in South Mumbai, which was a one hour cab ride away, unless there was traffic and there is almost always traffic."
4708,josephlandes,4,Solid Business Hotel in Mumbai Close to Airport,"I stayed in the Grand Hyatt last month in Mumbai and enjoyed the stay very much. It is not necessarily my favorite hotel in Mumbai but it is definitely right up there at the top.    The hotel itself is modern and new and very close (relatively speaking) to the airport.  After entering through security at the main gate of the hotel with your car, you go through another personal security gate and wanding and then you can enter the hotel. Something odd that I found about the hotel is that they put the check-in up a very large set of stairs. So you definitely want to get help from the bellman if you are carrying any amount of suitcases with you as it is a steep climb. Check in procedures were quick and painless.  I went to my room which was a standard room with a king size bed.  Bed‚Ä¶"

4711,Vinaybpl,5,Excellent,"Was on a business trip for 2 days. Pick up staff at the airport was friendly we told him to wait while we can grab a bite to eat and as soon as we were done he called for the hotel car. Took 15 mins from the Domestic Airport. Check in was fast, took less than 5 mins (I really like a fast check in). We orderd for room service twice it was fast and food was good. Room is spacious, clean with all enmities. Same goes for bathroom. Only downside Breakfast had less variety. However what were was on the plate was good in quality and taste."
4712,Happy Traveller,4,Excellent food. Good for Corporate get togethers and Luncheons. Place is swamped with mosquitoes.,We had a company sponsored stay for 2 nights as it was a yearly conference. The interior decor is Exceptional. Food is Great.  The rooms live up to the Hyatt standards though a bit old now. Overall restaurant staff and banquet staff was courteous. The breakfast served at their Fifty Five east was a very good experience. The security check guys and frisk activity guys are a minus point since these guys need training on behavior with guests.

My choice was Grand Hyatt this time.

4714,Abdullah Z,5,Wonderful experience and excellent hospitality,"The Grand Hyatt Mumbai is a beautiful hotel and is relatively close to many must see attractions. The hotel serves delicious food and snacks at the restaurants and as well as the room service.  The gym has all the required equipment. The pool is worth a visit, though it's a bit small and compared to other 5 star hotels the design is not very interesting.   Staff are very friendly and considerate and truly reflect the culture of Indian hospitality. Encountered a minor misunderstanding with a member of staff and the Assistant Front Office Manager, Biswa, helped resolve the issue to my satisfaction immediately.

The hotel is International 5 star standard, with the rooms having everything needed for a long or short stay.4 restaurants in the Hotel cater for a variety of tastes. The downstairs restaurant has an all u can eat evening buffet with a variety of foods and  free drinks included in the price.

4717,JEBreview,3,Convenient for BKC,"I recently stayed for a week during an event at the BKC (which is 15-25 minutes away by taxi). This hotel is about an hour to downtown Mumbai (taxi time can vary dramatically dependent on traffic). First impressions are very good, this a clean modern international hotel. I found reception and concierge service was excellent. Room was superb, comfortable, well appointed, and very clean. Breakfast buffet is vast with a large selection of Asian and western foods, although at busy times be prepared to ask 2 or 3 times and wait for your tea or coffee to be served. I ate on several occasions in the Indian and Italian restaurants, reciving good food and service in both, but the better value for money option is in the downstairs buffet restaurant.

4719,Vineet,4,A good business hotel,"Grand Hyatt is a good business option in Mumbai, located close to the airport as well as business areas.   The rooms and good, clean, well kept. There are lot of mosquitos in the area...though the hotel is making all attempts to keep them away.  The staff is efficient. The breakfast options are good, could be better.   Value for money."
4720,Chiranjib G,5,gr8 stay and lovely food,"Fantastic hotel stay, good service and great food. The buffet service here is simply the best that I have experienced with different sections around Indian, continental, Chinese, Thai and Japanese. Also a good wine menu. The rooms are large and comfortable. Service is very nice as well."
4721,Joey K,3,F & B service is poor,"i attended a 3 day conference in Grand Hyatt recently and I must say that the service and food quality is a big let down. There were no service staff to serve Masala Chai and when I called them to serve, each one just asked the other to do it and in the end i helped myself....not once, not twice but a few times. The food quality was poor and not up to mark for a 5 star hotel. I suggest more training and friendlier service is required for the staff.  otherwise i wouldn't suggest having a big conference in this hotel, not able to handle and cope with big functions."

Excellent location - 20 minutes drive from the international airport in the afternoon, and 10 minutes from the domestic airport for a late morning departure. Very convenient for business meetings in the north (MIDC) as well as the south (Nariman Point). Plus points - excellent buffet breakfast, extremely courteous staff, and excellent quality of toiletries. Lobby area very conducive for meeting business guests. Niggling points - room appeared dated compared to the Trident BKC where I had stayed a year earlier. Water accumulated in the shower area and sounds of dripping and draining continued for 15 minutes.

The restaurants were splendid, we tried the buffet for two meals and they were both excellent with a wide spread of cuisines ranging from Indian, Lebanese, Chinese etc. the dessert section was also excellent. The staff at the restaurant were very friendly and paid special attention to our requests with a nice special touch that made us feel extra welcome. The exteriors are a bit run down, but i could see extensive repair going on to spruce up the exteriors.  Overall great hotel to stay. I would stay again and also recommend to others. "

The rooms are very tastefully done and bathrooms are large and nice! the highlight is the buffet breakfast, quality of food is excellent and there is plenty to choose from. Staff are very courteous and service is prompt. Would definitely go back!"

Service is prompt and the location ideal, close to the domestic airport. U can, very quickly get on to the western express highway. Plenty of shopping in the hotel and the gym is well equipped with helpful trainers. China House is one of the best Chinese restraunts in the city, love the food. China House lounge is a buzzing and happening place to be post midnight. Has an entry fee/cover charge though. Good business hotel."
4726,av1anurag,4,Nice and Peaceful,This hotel is located just off the western express highway between the airport and Bandra Kurla Complex. The atmosphere inside the hotel is quite serene which suddenly strikes you after the gruesome travel on WEH. It is a nice place to arrange business meetings for the people on a short trip to Mumbai.
4727,Beardy Adventurer,5,First class hotel,"I have returned to the Grand Hyatt again and again on the simple basis of it being an absolutely top end hotel.   In addition to the general quality of the hotel and the restaurants, the service here always leaves me speechless. It may be a cliche but you really do get treated like royalty.  It may not be the cheapest hotel in Mumbai, but on each occasion I have stayed here I have absolutely got what I paid for. I genuinely look forward to vsisitng this place on business.  Thoroughly recommended, whether for business or pleasure."
4728,Amit B,4,Very good stay,This hotel is one of the closest hotels to my office and becomes an automatic choice for my business trips.   The rooms have all the modern amenities that are required by a business traveler. The rooms are quite spacious and are very well maintained. The breakfast buffet is sumptuous and has choices which can cater to guests from all parts of the world.   The security staff can be a bit pedantic at times and can leave you irritated!  Overall a very good choice for the business traveler.
4729,ushakrish,3,"Lovely Hotel, poor service","The positives: it is a very beautiful hotel, reasonably close to the airports and the resturants have some superb food. The coffeshop at the back is a great place for casual meetings and the shopping arcade is really nice for browsing. The rooms are of course very good given the price-band.  Where the hotel really fails is in service. Security personnel at the gate prod you with the wand instead of swishing it. No one comes forward to pick up your luggage. In the morning I was directed to wrong resturant for an early breakfast and was sent out after I sat down!! There is no complimentary airport drop....   Overall, I feel as though I am in an American Hotel, not an Indian 5-Star. Which is fine if you are a foreigner, I guess"

I have to wait for one hour for checkin because of wrong feeding of my name in their computer, they could correct it very very slowly, thats why me and my wife had to wait for more than one hour at midnight in their lobby.

Easily commutable to most of the attractions,just a minute away from the western express highway and 20 minutes away from International Airport. Very well maintained and clean rooms. The best I liked about the hotel is the heath club, swimming pool, spa,sauna,shops and tennis court,what else do you need? And don't miss the chinese restaurant 'China House' if you like good food and ambience. If you are lucky enough you might get to see Indian social events like weddings,etc."

Located very near to the airport and comfortable during the travel. Exotic choices of variety cuisines. A must recommended stay for family and business trips.
4735,Rob_DM,4,This is a very nice hotel - some noise issues,"I stayed at this hotel during a trade show, and must say that there was only 1 fault, and that is that the rooms are not very soundproof. Normally not an issue unless you have the neighbours from hell who hold parties in their room.  Room quality, service and food was very good, the hotel is well maintained and staff are polie and friendly. They were however not great at dealing with noise complaints. When this issue was brought to the hotel manager's attention it was resolved."
4736,Jsingh0,5,Great hotel!,The hotel is a fantastic business hotel.  Its not necessarily centrally located but still amazing.  The restaurants are great and so is the service.  The chinese restaurant had amazing peking duck and I really liked everything about this hotel.  It is definitely a business hotel so go with that in mind and prices are up there with international 5 star hotels so be prepared but you get your monies worth.
4737,arpitagr,5,"Excellent breakfast, adequate hotel","I visit Mumbai often and even though this hotel is slightly far from my workplace, I find it the best among all hotels I have stayed in, in Mumbai. Here's why - 1. The breakfast spread is LAVISH. The variety is just amazing. 2. The rooms are no-nonsense, clean, nicely renovated and spacious. The bed is very comfortable and not overly fluffy. 3. It is near the airport, so makes for a quick get-in-get-out. You need this in Mumbai due to the unpredictable traffic. Haven't really experienced the other hotel amenities. Tried the gym, again it was adequate. All in all, a good business hotel"

This time we stayed at Grand Hyatt, which is close to Domestic Airport along with our senior executives from our overseas head office.  While we hear about the experience of the stay here, we were pleasantly surprised to see, and experience of all the delights we heard.  We stayed for over four days and visited all the restaurants inside. The breakfast buffett was very good and the Italian gourmet was more than delicious.  I am sure who ever stays / visits this hotel in Mumbai, will get true value for money and above all ""FULLEST SATISFACTION"" R. BALAJEE CEO The Converging World"
4743,Ranz10,4,Good but does not meet the standards of grand Hyatt,Location was not that good ... Close to the high way but close to the slums as well .. On a lonely street ... But the time spent there was good ... Worth my money.. The breakfast here is the best I have seen till date in Mumbai .. Large menu and have kept it to a very good standard 
4744,Joy_tuscano,5,One of the best hotels close to Mumbai Airport,A grand place very close to the Mumbai International airport. The location is especially helpful if one needs to travel to different parts of the city. Its very spacious and comfortable. The restaurants are excellent and not that pricey considering the fact that its a Grand Hyatt. The bar is good to meet people and also for some small meetings. The Italian restaurant is good with its authentic Italian food. The staff is extremely helpful and resourceful.
4745,JKMorgan1978,5,Great Business Hotel,"Great experience at the Grand Hyatt, very comfortable and spacious. Service is very attentive as you would expect. Feels very safe and secure and restaurant offerings are first class. Good gym facility and the outdoor pool is pleasant but there is exterior work going on to the hotel so its not particularly pretty at the moment. I will certainly stay again, the proximity to the airport is great especially if you are using this as a base to get to other locations in India for the day such as Hyderabad/Bangalore/Pune."
4746,PickyglobetrotterUk,4,Fourth visit and still good,"A consistently good offering. I stay here regularly, normally taking a few rooms for a week. Location is good if you have to travel to different corners of Mumbai and it is relatively close to the airport. Club level is worth the extra cost. Excellent restaurants-buffet is very comprehensive, with foods from every continent. Chinese restaurant is great (very authentic, no Manchurian Chicken!) if expensive."
4747,Nahor,5,Perfect Stop Over,"This hotel is only a short transfer from the airport, it needs to be short when you land in Mumbai at 2:00am. Check in process is fairly slow, but this is usual when checking in for most hotels in India. A welcome surprise is that the restaurant is over 24 hours a day and serves good food even at 3:00am. Rooms are well appointed and have a number of small details which make this hotel a 5 star. Only minor point is that light switches were not wired correctly which made turning of all the lights in the room a little difficult. Breakfast is extensive with the choice to suit most guests, even my wife. Breakfast services wasn't bad, but with a few adjustment could be excellent. I would stay here again if I was not able to get a connecting flight at a suitable time. There are however‚Ä¶"

Pool is outdoor so not heated, but good nevertheless. Staff is friendly and helpful, expected at that price :) True luxury experience. Go For Itt."
4749,TheItinerantTinker,3,Largely impersonal,"This property is within 10 mins driving distance from the Mumbai domestic airport.  And it is big.  Hence it lends itself very well to corporate galas, wedding parties and fashion events.  Service and attention to detail is just average.  The food passes muster.  The rooms are spacious - not cosy and noise from the corridor can be very disturbing, particularly oif your neighbors are returning from some late evening partying.   The neighborhood outside the hotel is non-existent in terms of walks or shopping or entertainment or scenery.  If you are visiting India as a tourist, esp with family - this is no place to stay.  If you are a business person wanting to dash to the airport and all the boxes ticked in the hotel venue - this would do the trick."
4750,TracyFamilyGuy,5,Nice hotel! lovely breakfast,"Stayed at this hotel for a business trip. Staff was very friendly. I used the business center / lounge area. Folks there were very helpful.

4751,AnnRB,3,"A nice hotel, but management needs to be more diligent.","The good: Nicely furnished large rooms and spacious bathrooms.  The gym is large and well equipped.  The public spaces are bright and airy.  Garden/pool is a nice refuge from noisy Mumbai. Not so good: The breakfast choices were excellent, however the restaurant is a little overcrowded when the hotel is busy.  On the first day, there were no tables available, and every day the restaurant was slightly chaotic.  Perhaps an outdoor terrace could be added so the tables are spread out more. The Hyatt is away from the main road so a little inconvenient for tourists, but the hotel is a good price and easy commute as an airport hotel.  One of the problems with the location is the Cool Cab monopoly at the Hyatt.  It would not be a problem if the taxi company used its meters, but instead‚Ä¶"

4753,Nowhereelsetogo,5,Wanted to stay longer!,Unfortunately I was only in Mumbai for a quick stop over. But the stand out feature of this hotel was the foyer which had the most amazing art collection (tour available) I wish they didn't check me in so quickly so I had more time to view the art.  Breakfast buffet is one of the best I have had. Wish I could tell you more. Maybe next time!
4754,sridhar_srin,5,Excellent service,"Easily now one of my favorite hotels. Key is the attitude of the staff who are friendly and helpful without being overly obsequious. Pretty much everyone (door man, concierge, security staff, the waiters at the restaurant) appears to have been trained and monitored well. Rooms are decent. The buffet dinner in their main restaurant is easily one of the best I have come across.  Minor drawback is the continuous movement and chatter of hotel staff in the corridors through the day - if you are planning to spend any time working in your room, this can be a distraction."
4755,Lynnannpereira,4,Would love to stay at The Grand Hyatt again.,"Stayed there for 3 days in Room 3134 from Dec 28th - Dec 30th. Loved it. Special thanks to Deepak Sharma and Sadaf Shaikh from the F&B Department for their amazing Hospitality. Also a very special thanks to Shankar of the F&B and Pradeep of the HK departments for putting a huge smile on the face of my 2yr old son. God bless all of you. Best wishes, Mrs. Lynnann Pereira."
4756,Muskoka21,5,Well done! Our family really enjoyed it!,I'm staying at this hotel as we had a medical emergency while on tour. I can say the stay appeared very well trained and compassionate during our entire stay. The club level was a nice upgrade. The rooms are massive but comfortable. I must say the exterior (which is being renovated) is not consistent with the interiors which are very current and up to date. The location is excellent for access to the airports but obviously quite some distance to the cbd. Based on the property alone I would choose this over the Four Seasons. The restaurants appear above average. I would rate this property as excellent value and would not hesitate a return visit. 
4757,LCandBC,4,A few more helpful details,have stayed at eh Grad Hyatt around 10 time on business trips to Mumbai and have previously written a long review.  Wanted to add a few useful tips from stay this past week. - Hotel is currently under renovation and there is a lot of loud hammering going on at extended hour (not 24/7 but definitely during times you might want to sleep if you are traveling from other time zones. -  avoid rooms very close to the elevator. so many international guests arrive and leave at late night hours it is very loud near the elevators.  Bu be preared the quiet rooms can be a long walk down long hallways - worth it in my mind for quiet. - room doors are very heavy and don't alway latch shut - be sure your door is closed and latched when you leave. - wifi is 400 rs for 1 hour or 900 Rs for 24‚Ä¶
4758,Singkiwi,3,basic and ok,"starting to get a bit tired now, carpets are stained etc, the room was ok, linen was excellent. i try to avoid the service and like to be left alone. worked for me. staff were generally friendly. i paid for a club room but ended up on another floor with ""access"" to the club floor. apparently the rooms are the same?

4759,ARUN63512,4,GOOD CONFERENCE HOTEL,"I stayed in Grand Hyatt for a conference in the first week of November 2012, it is very close to the domestic airport and in a quite calm area which is unusual for a location in Mumbai. To my surprise the rooms are quite spacious being a old property and the frontage lobby is very good. The hotel service is good.  Food is very good. The property is quite old but still is maintained in a decent way.  Over all feel was  good. Ony at the time of chek in the counter person behaved like a government officer rather than 5star hospitality desk officer for not having a government ID proof and he was not willing to even go a extra mile to help me out."
4760,GOAL_Spring,3,An average business hotel,"This is a typical business hotel. It is a bit aged. Although the hotel provides basic and necessary amenities for guests. one will not get the feeling of personalized service as in most of the large hotels.  Staff are in general polite and friendly. For several floors, there are no connection between the rooms on the South Wing and North Wing. Once I went up by the South Wing lift and looked for my room for 10+minutes past mid-night after check-in,  despite there was a clear direction with my room number on it, the way was not through.  I had to come down to the lobby and walked to the North Wing.  Most of the international flights arrive Mumbai late and the reception staff were tired at those hours so this could be an easy overlook. The buffet breakfast had a wide spread of‚Ä¶"
4761,Sameer Kochhar,4,A large sized experience in city with cramped spaces,"Everything about Grand Hyatt is King Size, from the lobby to the rooms. Significantly bigger than most other five star properties in the suburbs. The staff is excellent though a bit forgetful. They forgot to write down my booking for the board room but managed to avert the disaster at the last minute. Complimentary drinks and beverages were adequate for the apology. Food in the hotel is generally very good."
4762,pranavkhanna,1,no one cares,"horrible service and no one cares. i am a platinum member with Hyatt and i have never stayed in a worse Hyatt property in my life!!!! I took a club room and it was the worst mistake of my life. The property lends its gardens for wedding functions with blaring music that carries on till after mid night and the guests have no choice but to be subjected to it!!! the hotel staff can do nothing about it!!!! i have always stayed at the Four Seasons, The Taj Lands end or the Oberoi. made a huge mistake by staying at the Hyatt. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"
4763,Kishan N,5,The best hotel in Mumbai Suburbs,"I spent 10 days here with my Wife and 2.5 year old baby while on a business trip, and the hotel staff exceeded all expectations. Room was perfect, everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel but the staff were the winners, they knew us by name and fell in love with my daughter and attended to all our needs without us having to ask. Food was very delicious in all the restaurants and i cant wait to return next year."
4764,JOB912,1,Disappointment,"As a business traveler I have  traveled extensively for years all over the world.  One way to stay sane is by managing my own expectations.  I've learned in India that the facility is one thing but the hotels have to be considered on quality of service.    This one leaves me sadly underwhelmed (and this is putting it nicely).  I don't plan to return to this hotel.  Feel free to stop reading here is you're busy.    If you are okay being in an area where you cant walk to anything (as this hotel is) then I recommend the Hyatt Regency near the airport.  Have never had a bad experience there.    Some specifics about this hotel:  - Noisy. Hallways, hammering in the courtyard, loud parties, etc.  unusually loud.   - staff issues.   They simply ""forgot"" certain transit instructions‚Ä¶"

Occassionally there is a wedding downstains but that did not bother us since there is a separate entrance etc.   The positives - there is a small shopping mall attached to the hotel in case one wants to do final shopping - we went to the saloon and the services was amazing. We felt at home. - there are so many restaurants to choose from especially indian, international, italian and chinese.

The pool was also very dissappointing and the location is far from the main tourist spots.  Very good hotel but its expensive!"
4772,Reisaapie,4,Lives up to expectation of a close to airport business hotel,"This is a good hotel and conveniently located close to the airport, but not you choice if you need to be in Mumbai downtown each day as that just takes to long.   Amenities are great with the best and most spacious gyms I have seen during my travels. This really helps you going there. The outside jogging track is uneven and due to the time of year, not worth going out to (smoke/fog) and a bit of a distance from the gym area.   Was not too impressed by the italian restaurant on site - decent, but nothing special.   The room was spacious, a spacious bathroom (separate shower) and well maintained. The outside of the building was less attractive though and in need of work on some of the stone walls."

Very convenient double lifts, excellent choice of restaurants and spacious rooms really do come in handy especially when u have a longish stay planned.

Location is good in terms of it being very close to BKC otherwise you have office buildings next door. The Hotel had good gym, swimming pool. What I liked best was reception, lobby area. Also there were ample varieties available during breakfast. What I like least was that the rooms were not quiet. The outside sound could be heard within room."

I stay here on average 2 times a month, so feel quite at home. Once in a while I have been put in a room that overlooks a very noisy part of the area then it is almost impossible to sleep. But all the rooms in the other wings are great.  Beware, however if you are trying to book a meeting room. Even if you are booked in as a guest when booking a meeting room, they will ask you to send copies of your credit card and a signed reservation form.

The Indian restaurant is awesome, when something isn't on the menu they'll just make it for you. Right outside of the hotel are slums, which is a bit of a weird feeling once you walk out the front gate - but this is the case in many hotels in Mumbai."

Room was spacious, comfortable, clean and well maintained. Food choices in the hotel were excellent with one of the best hotel breakfasts I've come across anywhere.. Service was helpful and responsive, fitness room was well-equipped. Only possible drawback is location. It is not in Mumbai proper and while convenient if you're doing business in the suburbs (where a lot of international business is done these days), it's not located near the tourist spots of South Mumbai. Highly recommended."

We came out of the airport...late at night, in India...it was good that we spot the Grand Hyatt pick up service, 15 mins later we were on the hotel limo, didnt inform us how much it cost until we paid the bill when we check out. We want to book a car for a half day tour...the hotel car...6000-7000 Rup (130US), we decided to order a taxi 1600 Rup (30US). Sure there were difference....but... The breakfast was great and the staffs were helpful. After all it was just another Hyatt....its location is 20 mins from the airport. If you want to transit on a early flight, you can consider this one."

Firstly, its located in a good location in Santa Cruz. Secondly, the staff behaviour is excellent and warm, the reception - the restaurants - room service - ISD Department - Laundry - Gym - concierge ...... absolutely everywhere I went !!  I have stayed in a number of Hyatt properties and also did stay in a few 4 and 5 star hotel and resorts in India, and GHM definitely is one of the best experience. Looking forward to be in Mumbai soon again!! Shall be reserving rooms - Hotel choice by default now!"
4782,ckatsuya,4,"Good hotel, good location","I'm a big fan of the Hyatt hotels, and was not disappointed by this one. Nice property, good service at reception desk, nice breakfast buffet. The hotel is going through some renovation, so it can be a bit noisy. Confess that I was a bit disappointed by the gym - it was a bit dark and too warm. Location is excellent, not too far from the airport and (fortunately) to most of my meetings, so can't really complain. This is a keeper. Will be back there if I ever have to go back to Mumbai."
4783,rahulbendre,5,A Great 5 star Experience,"The name say... Its grand and if its grand its Hyatt. near to airport, close to sea link to head to town side. This Hotel is one among the best. Huge rooms, perfect staff, Great environmental pleasures, amazing Italian food I have no regards to recommend this hotel to business or leisure family travelers. But remember good and best things in life come at a cost and mind you to experience the difference one has to pay. If you can afford the cost then this is one of the best hotel in Mumbai to stay."
4784,Ashish T,5,Awesome Place,Only stayed for a day. It was a corporate event. Great place for event. Also great food and services they offered. I was happy with the arrangements. Staff is very friendly.  The service is depicted by every member of the staff and they all are extremely warm & welcoming. It was nice experience to had been there. I would recommend this place for everyone.

4786,purecha,5,Night Stay @ Hyatt,What an amazing experience i had with Hyatt. Actually i had received a complimentry stay from my company for 1 night couple and believe me we enjoyed every moment of the same. The Food was superb we also visited China House which is a Pub inhouse. ROom service was excellent and staff is very polite and friendly. If you wish to stay closer to the Domentic Airport this is the place to stay.
4787,Dee D,3,"Fine on infrastructure, horrible attention to detail","Stayed overnight at the Hyatt, with a two day conference, for a client.   I've stayed at the Hyatt a couple of times before, and the infrastructure and food has always been as I expected of a valuable brand.  This time, however, I found it was the service that was below par. Both on arrival and leaving, our hands were full with bags and there was plenty of staff hanging around, no one bothered to open the doors or assist us.   At the conference, the first answer to any request was usually no. I had a bad throat and requested for hot water in a flask, as I had a bad throat- there was no flask! The next day I asked for a large white board, there was no large white board! And as always, it is not only about the refusal but also the curtness and indifference with which it is done.‚Ä¶"
4788,danielyeoenghow,5,Grand Club Room,"The experience which i had is nothing short of amazing. Every staffs in the hotel speaks good English and the staffs remembers you by your name which goes to show the tremendous effort by them in hospitality.  The service were very prompt and far exceeded my expectation, staffs over here tries to make your stay a memorable one.  When I was at loss for choice of food, the Guest Relations Executive tries to find out what kinda taste buds i have before making recommendations on the restaurants and food that they have here.Impressive i should say! The food was good, stay was memorable and I'll be sure to stay in the same hotel the next time i fly to Mumbai."
4789,shahrulnn,5,"5-star hotel, 5-minutes away from the Mumbai airport :)","I've stayed at this hotels for a few times, and I have to agree with other reviews about Hyatt's consistency. I enjoyed the selection of F&B offered, especially the breakfast buffet. The room is spacious, cosy with classy amenities. It is so near to the airport, and the hotel support going green by having hybrid cars for guests pick-up service (so nice!)  Throughout my stay, the person on the phone (be it housekeeping, room service or the front desk) will address me by my name and that made me impressed with the hospitality shown by the staff.  The only thing I wished for this hotel to improve is : please provide free Wi-Fi for your guests. Considering most of the guests are business travellers, having that kind of service will surely delighted them (me included)."
4790,Trikky123,5,Second Time Around,"My second stay this year at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai was as good as the first. Though it is not close to where it is all happening down Colaba way it is very close to the airport which is a real bonus, and it is very easy to get a taxi to wherever you want to go. As I always say a hotel is only as good as it's people and the staff of the Grand Hyatt as warm, friendly and efficient. The rooms are cosy, the beds are deliciously comfy  and they have great hairdryers. The hotel itself is spacious and has the most amazing artwork scattered beautifully around the hotels open areas. Last but not least all the restaurants within the hotel are outstanding. And they do a great special Grand Hyatt Mojito in the bar."
4791,953sweeted,4,Getting back to its 5star status,My last stay in january was not pleasant so being a gold passport member for 15 years I got in touch with the HQ and they convinced me to give it another try which I did first week of September. The rooms have undergone cosmetic renovation and mosquito problems have improved significantly. They have added staff to executive lounge which is the most important place for business traveller so breakfast is fast and food is excellent. Italian restaurant and china house are still very good. Pool is closed for renovation but used the residences section pool which is more peaceful  Only small issue is there was a wedding on Saturday night and I could here the loud music but they stopped at a decent hour. Will return again
4792,GoraDelhi,4,Spacious luxury accommodation in Mumbai,"The hotel provides huge space be it in lobby or in room and that is surprising in a city like Mumbai. The rooms have all the necessary details for a comfortable stay. The staff are very warm and friendly. I appreciated that the lost & found unit sent by courier my BlackBerry charger left behind in the room. The spread out for the breakfast is excellent, though it is here I found the space was a bit limited. Would not mind coming back again..."
4793,Tom M,5,The classiest airport hotel in Mumbai,"If your business travels take you to Bombay, odds are you ll be meeting with clients out by the airport rather than downtown. The Grand Hyatt is a truly elegant and well run place to hide from the daily pandemonium of the city.  The restuarants are great, the beer is not flat, and the service is flawless.  The rooms are comfortable, modern and immaculate.  The outside of the building appears a bit shabbythese days but the inside is great."
4794,Khalid Binshakir,4,Best 5 star Hotel in Mumbai,The hotel is located near Bombay domestic airport. It is close to the new buiness offices in Mumbai and away from the busy streets of Bombay. The hotel is well maitained and has large room. The club lounge is outstanding and food selection and quarlity is just the best.
4795,Vinod V,4,Best place for conferences,"Its been awhile since a hotel property got the formula right. Good property - personal or business. The lobby is so vibrant always. Rooms are just right.   But thats not what I am writing about: Their conference halls are the best bet you can have , doesnt matter what size of audience your catering to. Centrally located, good food spread and value for money when your looking to hold customer or entertainment in a 5 star hotel. Easily accessible, staff are courteous , clean and professionally managed. What more can you ask for, I say?"
4796,Mystic_travelling,5,An excellent business hotel,Want to shed of your day's wear and tear.... this is the place..  Its a typical business hotel with almost every facility in house. Really like the Italian food and the buffet (cant recall the restaurant at the level below lobby).  Gym is great and if you are not an indoor person you have a big garden in the back which is accessible 24 hours. All in all its stands to the Hyatt standards (although you get to see the filthy rich guys showing off in the lobbies and everywhere else public... but thats something bound to happen)... and last but not the least... not for those on tight budgets.... a simple meal for one could cost over a 1500 INR
4797,Alec Bowman,4,"Massively impressive to look at, best buffet in the world","SO it's spectacular to look at, with a huge waterfall indoors.   And the buffet downstairs (all you can drink beer included, they charge for water though) is the best I've ever had, it's simply delicious and I couldn't wait for each evening to roll around to gorge myself on Indian Cuisine.  Amazing outside pool, I suppose because it's so hot there that you dry in seconds that makes it amazing, the pool itself is just a big bunch of water in a hole. But, still they have these guys who are just there to scare off all the carrion so you can enjoy relaxing by it with a drink.   A great place to stay in Mumbai with work. You'll be struck by the heavy security on the way in and by the extreme poverty on the way out though.   Good enough rooms, go here for the food!"

4799,Aneesh2011,3,Great Hotel that needs to 'hold' its standards!,"When the Grand Hyatt Mumbai opened its doors about 7 years back, it brought about a change in the standards of hospitality in the city of Mumbai. The hotel was well designed, luxurious, staff were well trained and it had a great deal of finesse. This continued and the Grand Hyatt became a landmark in the polarized structure of Munbai's business locations - i.e., in North Mumbai.  And, then things have rapidly changed.  Off late, one feels that the priority of the hotel is to take more wedding functions and birthday parties - clientele of those genre - wherein rooms accommodation is thrown in as an incentive to book the large functions. So, the hotel has transformed itself from being a business hotel.  A direct result - even Diamond Members like myself are not made to feel‚Ä¶"

The bed was a king size and one of the softest i have slept in a long time and the pillows were goose down and to die for. If not for anything else, i will come back to just rest my back on that bed.

Lavishly appointed with Jaisalmer sandstone and black granite in the bathrooms, the rooms have everything a weary traveler would need. I especially loved the powerful shower, it evoked memories of being caught in a heavy tropical downpour. The friendly staff are just a call or a turn away from you. The dining facilities are top notch, as check in and check out effortless. I was a little worried at all the extra security precautions since my last stay there, and guess it is good to know that you are secure. Add this to the convenience of major highways and conveniently available cars (at a price) from the hotel, you can assured of all the pampering you can think or need."

I have seen much better offerings served at other comparable hotels. I had ordered south Indian dish at the breakfast counter, which they never served- poor. Small swimming pool was again disappointing."
4814,JeromeMarrel,3,A good property but poor service,"The property is good and in a great location, less than 10 minutes from the domestic airport. Service was poor. Long wait in the coffee shop, inefficient room service(ordered a meal for two, was asked if we were two but got a set up for only one so the food was cold by the time we got another set of cutlery), very bad cooking smell in the elevators as all restaurants with open kitchen are open to the lobby as well. Work was going on in the room next to us so we had noise and polish smell for 5 days. Nobody told us at check in. Check in can take up to 15 minutes"

The rooms were comfortable with all modern amnesties (such as rain shower, 42 LED TV, bose sound system ect)  in the executive floor. The only down side being that you cannot order any food at the executive lounge. It was strange that while having a meeting at the lounge I was not allowed to order some food from the hotel itself (which I was willing to pay for). Also for some stranger reason  you also cannot order anything while seated at the hotel lobby.

Firstly, the hotel is located fairly close to the airport and off the beaten path in a nice and quiet area. The hotel is pristine and the art decor is very interesting. Dining at ""55 East"" is a great experience.  You are engaged in conversation with your servers and the Chefs.  Everyone shows concern as to how you feel and how your day is going. If you are dining alone, no problem, It is truly a family atmosphere. At Grand Hyatt Mumbai...you are royal."

It is a haven to retreat to after a busy day in Mumbai and ideally located for the international and domestic terminals at the airport (c.20-30 minutes away depending on time of day and traffic). I tend to use it as a hub to base myself at and travel to other cities in India during the day.  Starting with the pluses, the hotel has strong leisure facilities (including an outdoor pool and massage facilities which are great after a long haul flight) and a good range of restaurants.   The pick of the restaurants is the China House - try the duck, it is comfortably the best duck I have had and is chopped up with incredible skill in front of you by the chef.

I conducted a business meeting in the club - and it was very pleasant.  The hotel has several excellent restaurants. Everything is very clean and well managed.

Room are average size but properly furnished. Service is excellent and there is a good size pool.  To operate the lifts you need your room key otherwise you have to wait for another person with a key to come.  We ate breakfast and lunch at the hotel and I found the food bland for my taste.

Simply not worth for the kind of price one pays.  2) Bathroom layout is weird. Very uncomfortable. The shower area very near the tub. After a bath you would find water splashed everywhere 3) Extremely expensive F&B room service menu 4) They charge Rs.1500 for a one way 3 Km ride to the airport. Big joke.

I stayed in this property as part of an official function. I shared a room with a colleague, I believe room no 6246 (if I recall correctly).  We both felt that the room did not have a grand feel at all - the decor was absolutely confused. A mix of laminates were used - light brown with shades of yellow and grey. The two together looked atrocious. The bathrooms were lousy - water from the shower area leaked out on to dry area - an inherent design issue. At the ballroom, a bar had been set up for all of us. The staff there was absolutely indifferent to what we all wanted. The only saving grace was breakfast, which was pretty decent!"

Frankly, they need to close the hotel for 2-3 days and completely fumugate it.  It is ridden with mosquitoes almost everywhere.

It is very luxurious and in your room, putting your bathrobe and those white cozy slippers on, you feel nearly at home. Very comfortable bed and pillows and for India, of course, its air conditioned. The marble bathroom had a separate tub and shower and was very clean. High speed Internet access in every room. A few different restaurants with good quality foods. All in all, great stay.

Rooms are well set out with large bath and bathroom in typical Grand Hyatt style (though Tokyo is better), internet good, although more traditional Indian hotels have larger rooms.  Service is a bit fussy eg your are forced to give up your bags on entry because of the long flight of stairs up.  The China House Lounge is one of the choice party night venues for the Mumbai elite."

The rooms are nice, very comfortable and spacious.  Shower room was great, a little short on toilettes.  Breakfast was fantastic, would highly recommend it.  One minor issue is the flight of steps you are confronted with as you enter the building.

The staff from the Front Desk to the Facility staff were genuine, sincere and most welcoming.  The only downside to this hotel is its physical location - there is not a huge amount to see or do within walking distance, but a short death-defying run out on a put-put soon has you in the centre of town enjoying all it has to offer."

We ate at the Indian restaurant in the hotel which was delicious, satisfying and came in large portions.   What gets you is the inefficiency. Checking in and out was SLOW. Slow to the point that when I realized how slow it was and kept watch of time, it still took another 5-7 minutes. Even more frustrating was organising a car with the hotel. I needed a car for two trips during the day. I emailed ahead, but when confirming the car arrangement at check-in, they had no knowledge of this and I had to go through the destination, time, return time, etc again. I presumed the car would be ready as arranged, but when I went to the‚Ä¶"

However, this time we had a real problem and they did not seem to realise the seriousness of the issue.  Travelling out to India we paid the hotel bill with our credit card, which was unused again until we came to checkout at the hotel upon our return from holiday three weeks later. When we tried to pay we discovered that the card had been stopped. Having checked with our credit card provider we discovered that the card had been used fraudulently, 4 times in the UK with two further fraudulent attempts for larger sums, one in another country, fortunately spotted and stopped by our credit card provider.

The Hyatt training program has turned the staff of this hotel into clones- they speak the same way, are way too stiff, and they may actually be robots with a layer of skin on top to make them look human. Professionally trained staff can be efficient without being so overly formal. I hated checking in and out, ordering drinks or food because the tone of each staff member I spoke to was identical. Hyatt needs to bring in some Brits, Aussies or Kiwis to run the training programs so they can bring a little levity into their staff's lives which then rubs off on the way they work.

It is a good property conveniently located for business travelers. However, the rooms are tired looking and need to be renovated. The staff at the club lounge are generally very good but the rest of the staff are in serious need of training. They are slow to respond and generally lack initiative. They ere so bad that I had to get the staff at the Trident, Nariman Point (where I also stay sometimes) to complete a simple task that the staff at the Grand Hyatt could not, or would not do, without creating hurdles. The concierge desk is particulary bad and disorganized. The club lounge had mosquitoes and they do bite. Having said that, there are some staff who are very good but they mainly work at the club rooms level.‚Ä¶"

The check in, Check out experience was horrible and incredibly slow. It took over 3 reminders and over 30 minutes to get Room service to clear the trays. The in room equipment needs to be modernized --no centralized control panel, loos without shower cublicles.

This place still looks amazing since being here 2 years around the same time early March. The concierge while checking in already knew that we had been here before after checking passed records. The only recommendation i will make is that if you can include a breakfast package in your stay it would be wise!!! plus the bonus is they include complimentary internet use, cocktail hour in the Grand Club with hot h'orderves. The breakfast here is just amazing!! fresh juices, freshly baked pasteries, eggs made to order they just have a great buffet!!!"

Located not far from the airport and near Bandra Kurla Complex (location of many office buildings) well north of main downtown area.  There is nothing near the Hyatt, but it an easy trip (in Mumbai standards) to businesses in BKC and  Bandra and the airport. But be prepared to drive (well actually be driven) everywhere.  Further from airport than the other Hyatt which seems to help with late night airplane noise (though planes can still be heard.)  They offer a pick up service from airport when arranged in advance which is worth doing if you're coming in late at night and unfamiliar with the area or a woman traveling alone.

I called the duty manager who sent up a pest control team and assured me it would not happen the next night but sure enough it did for 3 nights in a row !  The last time they told me there was nothing else they could do. Its gets worse however i booked a spa treatment the last night and sure enough half way through i started to get bit  The hotel is simply too busy - every time i called the concierge they put me on hold or promised to call me back which they never did  Make matters worse i argued at the checkout for some type of compensation and they did not tell me on monday‚Ä¶

This was my first trip to Mumbai and I was very wary of the food having read some horror stories.  Because I was on the club level I had access to the club lounge and thought that because it was a 5 star hotel the food would be generally safe to eat.  However, I ended up very ill and had to see a doctor later in my trip - I had picked up an infection from contaminated food.  So, just because it is a 5 star hotel does not mean the food is ok.  Otherwise, the hotel was nice - rooms and bathrooms were very nice.  The staff were polite but not 5 star hotel staff."

However, the Italian resturant at the Hyatt was a really pleasant surprise. The menu is fantastic and the service equally good. The outer facade of the hotel requires repair and the security although nice to have, takes very long. The hotel must accomodate smokers are they really suffer due to one smoking zone and that also outside."

Rooms are just ok on Bombay standards. Food is just too bad, no restaurant (apart maybe the chinese) makes you feel going back. If you have many meetings all around Bombay it can make sense for its position, as it is more or less in the middle between all possible locations, otherwise it is really far from everywhere."
4899,travel_r2012,2,"central location, nice hotel in filthy surroundings","I stayed in the Grand Hyatt while on my business trip few weeks ago. I was very impressed with the hotel , the staff and the food. However the filthy surroundings in the neighborhood makes this hotel very undesirable. One has to walk thru a tiny lane surrounded by slums to visit a medical shop and other food items. The slums and the filthy rivulet next to it can be source of infectious diseases for anyone in the vicinity. While these are not the problems of the hotel they do have the influence with the government to clean up the surroundings. I have seen kids squatting on the roads on the way to the medical shop. I would advise visitors to get ready for such shocks if they venture outside the hotel."
4900,Claudio C,4,Very beatutiful hotel with plenty of good restaurants inside,I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for Business Reason. It's in a good position being at 10 minutes drive from the airport. It's a very good hotel in line to what you can expect from a Grand Hyatt all over the world. The palace is wonderful beautiful but what I found very attractive was the presence of a very nice and good restaurants within the building. If you can afford the price I strongly suggest to stay in this hotel

The staff was helpful, service was prompt, friendly and efficient. In the 'suburbs' of Mumbai which I liked but others may not as the traffic is hell on wheels. It is near the airport though which is my preference. There was the odd mosquito in the lobby at night but hello, this is India. There were also mosquitos in the other hotels I visited, including the fine Oberoi in Agra. Everything was lovely and I think it deserves to be said. They also organized a city tour with a terrific government registered guide Mala whom I highly recommend. If you can afford to stay in this hotel, you can afford a good guide!"
4904,LazyoneBird,2,Grand 'Mosquito' Hyatt,"Stayed first time at this property in Mumbai. I am a regular in Mumbai and have stayed in all 5* hotels. This hotel is the worst so far. The location is one of the filthiest in Mumbai. The hotel was full of MOSQUITOES !!! they were everywhere. Lobby, restaurants, gym....I had to get my room sprayed. Better get your anti-mosquitoes lotions and sprays. To top it off, the staff wasn't warm and a bit cold / curt at many times (security guards, check-in and even the lady who ushered us into the Italian restaurant for dinner). Maybe there are being bitten by mosquitoes as well...Though rooms are good and quality of Italian food was excellent. The chef prepared a meal for me as per my specifications."

The breakfast buffet was your typical international fare with made to order omelets and a decent selection of hot and cold items. Due to my crazy schedule, I only ordered room service for my dinners, but the meals were always prompt, warm, and decent tasting.

Tight security [cars have to go through 2 checkpoints and cars searched/checked for bombs] before you can even get to the front door.

It contains several beautifully decorated restaurants - all with fantastic service.  There is a choice of Indian, chinese, western, italian restaruants.

Very friendly and helpful staff (good drivers!).  The only real complaint is that the rooms can be noisy from sources the hotel can't manage.  Lots of dogs barking all night long and the hotel seems to be in the take-off flight path from the Mumbai airport which doesn't close.  So all night long you hear barking dogs and flights taking off overhead.  One recommendation is to book a courtyard-view room to eliminate the noise from the dogs.  Restaurants are pretty good.  I'd stay there again, in a different room and with better earplugs."

Celini has amazing italian food. the bar is pretty stylish and has a wide array of alcohol. a dat bit pricey though. China house is an all time favourite. gets pretty crowded on the weekends though. the pool is pretty nice and clean too. the rooms are very modern, very classy and very well maintained. the location is fantastic too! pretty much in the centre of a big linear city! proximity to domestic and intl airport is pretty good.‚Ä¶"

Internet bandwidth is way below expectation (1.8Mbps down/2.7Mbps up, bizarrely, from speedtest.net) with high latency and frequent timeouts.  A colleague relayed to me that the hotel switched (read: downgraded) internet providers recently, which may account for some of the poor performance.  It's a great hotel with quality food and restaurants and I imagine I will return on my next visit."

During our time, we dined at the 55 East buffet resaturant as the variety was good for the younger members of our party, the range of food there was brilliant and the open kitchen and chefs working there were very friendly and helpful.

We did these events in 4 cities but the Grand Hyatt was the best by far in terms of facilities, conference room quality, service staff professionalism etc.  The rooms were also good and the food at the restaurants was very good too. I especially like China House, its an old favorite of mine.  The only downside is that this place is pricey in Rs terms but on par with hotels of this class."

The staff is very friendly in all places and the Aperitive hour served in the Hyatt club ( 2nd floor if I am not mistaken) is a real treat.

Positive points: room very comfortable, food great, most staff very helpful. Negative points: concierge - only one available so if he is on lunch or helping another guest you're in for a long wait.  Housekeeping was not up to scratch - I found a long black hair on our bed in a supposedly clean room (all house-keeping staff I saw were men with short black hair); one room we were in had greasy hair marks on the bed headboard.

I usually pay the extra for the 'king/ executive club' which provides access to the lounge on the first floor where one can enjoy a nice quiet drink after work or a more private breakfast in the morning.  The wines are usually good and there is quite a nice buffet in the evening before 8pm.  The staff are excellent and usually remember my name.  I've also had great experiences with concierge and front desk staff as wel.  They are very helpful and willing to find information on local tours or places to visit.  From a tourist perspective,this hotel is about 30 mins drive to downtown.  Doesn't cost too much in a local can, but hotel can will cost around‚Ä¶"

Rooms are lovely and spacious with a nicely set out bathroom and a toilet that flushes properly (in India!!).  Location is not fantastic if exploring Mumbai but we had a driver to take us around.  Obviously being a 5* place meant that prices were through the roof, especially if you go out and about in Mumbai but at least we were guaranteed cleanliness and no 'Delhi belly.'  We tried to used a computer in the business centre but warning to all, the internet connection is totally rubbish and we lost what we were working on plus they charged us over ¬£4 for 30mins!

4926,LondonCindy,5,Brilliant Hotel to stay in Mumbai,"This Hotel was really good and we really enjoyed our stay for 3 nights.  The Hotel was clean and the service was great.  There is a good selection of places to eat within the Hotel if you don't want to go out......Abit on the pricey side though, but the food is really nice especially in the Soma restaurant and the buffet breakfast in the Fifty East is brilliant. The location is also good, as you can get taxis and even rickshaw right outside the Hotel which takes you anywhere you want at reasonable price.  Will definately be staying here again on our next visit."
4927,Troy-was-here,5,Fantastic experience,"I have stayed at this property countless times over the years. Really the only bad thing to say is that some times the staff can be a little absent minded, but a great experience with staff as a whole.  The room design is perfect for the room size and they are very well appointed. Excellen dining and shopping options within the hotel but can be on the pricey side.  Great pool area to relax after a day out in Mumbai (remember insect repellent as the Mosquitos are relentless). Coffee frappes are a must!  If you are in India during NYE this is the place to be. I was there for NYE 2010 and they threw the most lavish parties downstairs in all off the function rooms and everything was free once you got in - Champagne, cocktails, lobster, you name it.

During that time we'd stayed in a wide variety of hotels, none of which were quite as Western as this one. For some people that will be a positive, but not everyone will feel the same way. On balance I have rated this highly for a number of reasons. Firstly, the service was excellent throughout - from reception to room service to restaurants to the lobby area. Second, the quality of the facilities is very high indeed - feels luxurious throughout. Third, the room was huge and the bathroom almost as big - very helpful as there were four of us staying there. Fourth, very wide choice of restaurants (for some reason we ended up in the Italian restauarant and had a great pizza).  It's important to‚Ä¶"

The in-house restaurant - Soma - serves tasty meals. The staff are friendly. However, please be warned that the hotel is not a family hotel. It is more for business people.   The only negative is that the hotel is far from central Mumbai (about an hours drive). One must get to the city centre by taxi (500 rupees). Otherwise if you like shopping, you can get a tuk tuk (40 rupees) to take you to Linking road where there are many saree shops, clothes stores, markets and fast food restaurants (KFC). The trip should take you half an hour. Hope this helps."

Its located a little far off but an amazing place to be at.  Fantastic food + awesome architecture (very modern looking). Must i say its one of the best places in Mumbai one can stay at.
4932,PAK_IV,4,Grand Hyatt is a beautiful island hotel,"Its an island though, alone between the shanty towns of Santa Cruz and the airport.  Its not well situated to get anywhere in Mumbai.  The food though is spectacular.  The rooms are extremely modern and well-fitted.  There a couple of issues with wait staff for morning breakfast who were inattentive and with housekeeping who did not respond swiftly to requests as they should in such a luxury hotel. its a great wedding hotel in Mumbai though, which makes for some wonderful spectacles...I like the hotel but would stay elsewhere next time...."

It was a good hotel except that front desk staff were merely robotic extensions of their computers without any professional or personal touch. May be there were all trainees of a school.  I was picked up by them from the airport for a stay (meeting) and was told that would be dropped off via a prior arrangements made by the meeting organizers. They had my outgoing flight number. I checked out asked if I would be dropped off as per the arrangement. They referred to their computer and said no and ask the event organizers. I was planning to take a cab of my own. At this point I met the event organizer and told him. He asked me not to insult them by going in the cab as he had made firm arrangements already with the hotel. He made a‚Ä¶
4934,SKCSC,4,"Great location, Good service, impressive Lobby and Restaurants, Business friendly","The imposing lobby and expanse is the most impressive part of the hotel. The rooms that overlook the garden and the pool are very good and provide a resort like feel. The property has been around for a few years now and therefore not the most modern in feel and ambience but well kept and well serviced. The marquee restaurants are popular both with resident guests and locals. The gym and spa are good. Overall, the hotel provides a very satisfying experience."
4935,Destinationdesign,5,Excellent International Business Hotel,"This hotel could not be faulted when it comes to a business hotel.    The Club Lounge is excellent, staff really amazing, great food and wine selection.  The rooms are nicely decorated, a little underwhelming.  Our room looked over the courtyard so was quiet (not particularly big), but we were with friends who looked over the city and they found it noisy.  Our bed was so comfortable.  The location isn't fabulous for tourists, takes ages to get anywhere and is is not a great area.  We had a function here which was excellent.    Spa was very nice."
4936,manish_s31,3,no ocean here,"yes, this is one of the few 7 star hotels in bombay, which is not overlooking any sea or ocean. it is purely a business proposition and caters to one. though internally it is like a mall, with a shopping centre inside, where one can splurge and collect a few indian artefacts, while on the move. yet it means only business, as it is much closer to the international airport than other mumbai hotels."
4937,Aerowbx2u,5,Can't wait to go back,"Loved,Loved this hotel! Will be returning in February!"
4938,OnAir52184818691,4,Not Bad but not so Grand,"The big challenge of being a Grand Hyatt is that you have a huge brand reputation to live up to. I have stayed in many and you can guarantee that a GH will be good and that you will have a very comfortable nights sleep. From the outside and the public areas this one is no different. The rooms, likewise, are standard (high quality) fair - but the journey between the two is rather disappointing. It sprawls and it is a tad grotty. Don't get me worng, in all the important aspects it is a perfect place to stay for a business traveller in Mumbai (where location is paramount) it is just that with a little bit of extra effort on the bedroom levels it could be a real jewel in the crown."
4939,mastersview,3,review,as far as i have experienced in this hotel is it was a true luxury and a great campus of the hotel.Food quality is of course good.Its a choice of a royal.I would recommend one should experience the stay inthis hotel.
4940,Sunil Yajaman,5,Excellent,"Its clearly one of the best hotels in India. Very large, lot of space and even the rooms are very modern and spacious. Good facilities and wonderful service. Staff were very courteous. A very happening night club too. Proximity to airport was added advantage. Great food and overall, had a wonderful stay."
4941,BeachSwaggie,5,Outstanding business hotel,"As far as I am concerned this is THE business hotel for Mumbai unless your business is at the ¬†Narriman Point end of town. ¬†It is also a fantastic hotel for a one night stopover in Mumbai between flights. That said, this is really¬†NOT a tourist hotel as it is in a pretty sterile location and well away from most points of interest. ¬†For tourism, and if you can afford it, i would suggest either of the Tajs.  The rooms at the Grand Hyatt are probably the best in Mumbai. ¬†Tney are both very large and very well appointed.  Service levels in the hotel are excellent and the restaurants are all very good. The wireless¬†¬†Internet works well throughout the hotel.  A classy elegant hotel which I would highly recommend"

4943,jnat1972,5,"spacious and good service, central location","I was pleasantly surprised. The Grand Hyatt, in a dodgy neighborhood, more than makes up with excellent rooms, great service and central location which is critical in traffic-locked Mumbai. A bit pricey but ran into lots of friends from the VC/business community in the lobby, enjoyed a good buffet in the basement hotel, and made it to all my meetings in various parts of town besides meeting a number of people in the hotel itself. I had also packed shabbily and the housekeeping got me shaving foam, razors and such promptly."
4944,DebbyTravel1974,5,"Spacious room, wonderful staff, nice restaurants","The entrance is dazzling, the art and light in the lobby is beautiful. The room is spacious and nice, bathroom clean and good shower. Forest Essentials products in the bathroom are excellent. A great hotel in the northern part of the city, a bit far from the action, but a taxi or motorized riskha is arranged on request and very cheap, so choose this hotel for Mumbai, if you want to discover the city. Concierges of the hotel (Sibi Mathew and Gurpreet) made our stay extra special by recommending a tour through Dharavi slum ('slumdog millionaire shoot location), naadi astrology  and train ride to Churchgate. Fantastic tours!!! The staff in the restaurants is extremely friendly and make you feel at home immediately, breakfast is very very good. You can eat anything, Indian and‚Ä¶"

We stayed in a wing of the hotel called the Residences, for long-term guests, which included a separate bedroom, kitchen and large bathroom. Use of a staffed child-care center was also included. Beautiful pool and amenities. After a month-long backpacking trip across India with our three kids, this hotel was a real treat!"
4946,EugeC,4,Very good hotel but a bit isolated,"The Grand Hyatt Mumbai is a good, comfortable oasis in a desert. The hotel itself is generally at international standards that one would expect from Hyatt, with helpful staff, business center, several good restaurants inside, etc.  However, the hotel sits close to the airport but otherwise in the middle of nowhere. Extreme poverty can be seen a few dozen yards from the walled, protection of the hotel, and the hotel is far from Mumbai's main business districts."
4947,ducky1976,4,Fantastic hotel - just sort the admin staff,"Stayed here for 3 weeks on business & the hotel is amazing. The grand club rooms are huge, very well fitted & the best I have stayed in. The restaurants are all very good & serve delicious food at all hours. The range of food options is also very good - the Chinese being my personal favourite. The pool & gym facilities are also brilliant, & the deli in the shopping plaza is delicious. The only thing that let's this hotel down is the admin staff. Took them ages to do the simplest tasks, if they did them at all despite being asked in advance. If Hyatt sort this one element out this hotel would be unfaultable. As it is its still impressive & well worth a stay"
4948,Guerobribiesca,4,Very Good for business trip,"I stayed at the hotel for a business trip.  The service was excellent and overall the room was great.  Security was also very good and tight which is important in Mumbai.  It is conveniently located near both airports and close to many business districts.  The only downside is that there is nothing to do around the hotel, and is very far from the historical center of Mumbai, so if you want to visit the India Gateway or other monuments you have to be prepared for a long taxi drive which by itself can be considered a whole adventure.  It also counts with three restaurants: Indian, Italian and Chinese with very good f.ood on all three.  Sunday brunch is very good."
4949,Rubes007,2,Poor advent for a 5 star property,"I was very disappointed with the stay, poor service throughout the stay, poor selection of breakfast, nothing much in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. I guess for a business traveler, the only plus point is that it is located next to the airport, other then that I could not think of many positives for this property."
4950,BebeSA,4,Luxury and comfort,I was fortunate to stay in this amazing hotel. It is close to the business center and airport shuttle services can be arranged. You get a sense of space in this hotel. The rooms are beautifully decorated and always clean.  You have many restaurant choices which range from buffet to al la carte and Italian to Chinese. The choice is yours. Room service is also very good especially after a long day full of meetings. My favourite was the buffet with many different dishes to choose from.  The staff were always very helpful and friendly. The contrast between the luxury inside the hotel and poverty a few hundred meters away on the outside is something to get used to.
4951,Galfons,4,"Great room & location, regular breakfast for European","I had a very short stay in this hotel, during a business trip. Nevertheless, I could appreciate its great location (very near to both the international and domesti terminal of the airport, still in a quite environment) as well as the gorgeous room (to excessively wide but full with all needed optionals in bathroom, aircon, tv, etc.). To be improved: breakfast. It was not more than regular for an European, missing ham and orange juice to be paid separately. Service was, indeed, very good as courtesy and promptness."
4952,Bryce B,5,Modern luxury in India's most populated city,"A huge and hugely impressive hotel in Mumbai's Santacruz district, this Grand Hyatt focuses on guest comfort.  Service is definitely key here, but in a more professional way suited to the class of clientele.  It's not the same kind of warm, personal service that is the star at, say, the Taj West End in Bangalore.  This is not a knock and in no way indicates the service is less; just different.  I always felt well taken care of.  The rooms are large and comfortable, although the closet was a bit on the small side.  It was a little difficult storing 8 days worth of clothes.  The bathroom features a great open stone shower and a deep tub.  Floor to ceiling window, with motorized sun shade, looked out onto the outside water feature.

The propoerty is gorgeous and the staff was very attentive.  you couldn't venture very far without a staffer asking if they can assist you.  My room was very spacious and clean - rivaling any 4 star hotel in the United States.  I ate dinner at Soma and breakfast at 55 East.  Food selection was extensive and service was friendly and fast.  I would highly recommend this property for your next trip to Mumbai!"

Last time I stayed there was Dec, 2010. This hotel really lives up to Grand Hyatt Standard if not more. The hotel itself is stunning. Room is beautiful and the breakfast is decent. Great service and very freindly staff. The location is close to airport which is great if you are just here for business. I had my conference in the conference hall right next door and had several meetings with my suppliers just at the hotel cafe/bar areas. The food at the restaurants in this hotel is amazing. Love the gym and the pools !!! The 100 metre jogging track is definitely a delight for any joggers ! You definitely get the luxury feeling at this joint. It's going to be my one‚Ä¶"

Amazing rooms, I really enjoyed mine, wet room etc, I thought it was beautiful.  Breakfast was gorgeous, to be honest too much bombay sapphire the night before meant i didn't get the full experience, however I thoroughly enjoyed it. Huge variety and food from everywhere.  Best concierge I've had, the lad was great, changed all my flights, as I threw a last minute Taj Mahal experience in there.  The Club, China White, was awesome, however getting there was a tad confusing, that said, really fabulous atmosphere with Bollywood's finest.

The interior is magnificent...The shopping arcade inside the hotels offers you lots of options from Jewels to electronics to dress accessories...  Food is excellent...  Grt room service...
4960,Sameer F,4,Really big and nice.,"The hotel is seriously big with a huge 2 floor shopping area.The rooms are just like any other 5 star hotel.Staff is help full,Location is not bad either.Food is decent.The best part is the central open courtyard which looks beautiful during the night.Be careful while giving out the address or while telling about the hotel to anyone as there are 2 hyatts in mumbai,the other one is near the airport."
4961,Nitin J,4,Good Hotel,I stayed in Hyatt for 2 days during my client visit in september.   Room service was fine with basic room amenities being present. Complementary airport transfers was also given.   Complementary breakfast was good with multiple options in the Kitchen. Pricing compared to other 5 star hotels was good.    I would like to recommend it to people with budget of around INR 8000 per day.
4962,snishith,4,Very good hotel ... but some gripes,"We love this hotel ...usually stay with family. Went back after some gap. Had to book, then cancel because child was unwell, then re-booked as we still decided to travel ... for same date, same room, 4 pm to 5 am next morning, this time was charged 25% higher. No adjustments/ understanding from front desk. Food was good as usual, service was generally great. Rooms getting old ... bathroom door was stuck, and pointing out to staff didn't get any response. Still overall good experience ... marred next morning by an unreasonable charge for drop off to airport - which is a 10 min, 5 km ride."
4963,PrithviHaldea,4,Nice business hotel,Very close to the domestic airport; ideal if business/work is in suburb or in BKC area;  very business-like ambience; not a holiday/fun place; rooms are very clean but drab; nice breakfast spread; lively chinese restaurant; very large banquet hall
4964,Prabhatkatyal,5,"Truly an experience to stay in Hyatt, Mumbai","Hyatt Mumbai is located very close to Mumbai Airport and its is just a 15 minutes drive from airport to hotel. The hotel offers excellent rooms and excellent facilities for all its guests. The finest of luxury and comfort are available in this hotel but ofcourse at a price. Overall the stay is so comfortable that you feel that the money paid is worth. The hotel has multi-cuisine restaurants, fitness centre, pool all what one can desire for in a luxury hotel. The food served is also delicious for one and all and they have all the cuisines in the book. If you are looking for the best in Mumbai then surely go for this one."
4965,randy b,4,Great value for a 5 star hotel,"I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt after a 3 week business trip to Pune for a couple of days of R&R before 24 hours of flying. My only gripe is that I am a Gold Hyatt Member and because I booked on-line I wasn't booked in a Hyatt Club room even though I confirmed before hand. That having been said, the hotel was a great value for the room. Even the basic room is quite nice, very comfortable and quite. The real treat is the staff and food. Everyone is top-notch and the best at what they do. Even my beers were poured perfectly! Food was extraordinary. I would come back just for the food and the service. The hotel was also gracious enough to extend a late check out for my 11 pm flight back to Newark."
4966,Rachel T,5,Great place for long business stays -  A home from home,"This has to be the best hotel in Mumbai !!! I have stayed here altogether for 14 months on and off for business over the last 3 years. The staff will do anything to make you feel at home and will cook anything that you ask if you are feeling a bit home sick. This is the the hotel to stay in if you are in Mumbai on business.  The pool, gym and spa is great for days off and relaxing and the club is always busy."

I was the only customer then.... called to apologise and offered to do a free upgrade instead. However, on checking out, checked my bill and was billed for the upgrade...told me was a mistake and amended the invoices...  The second morning asked the staff where to have the buffet breakfast and was pointed 'walk straight to the end and turn left'...So we walked all the way to the end but was not the restaurant for buffet breakfast.... Another occasion asked for carrier bag at the counter and was pointed to ' get from concierge'.....Is this the service standard for Grand Hyatt....I think the whole front desk service needs‚Ä¶"

You will remember your visit to Mumbai!  Personally I love the place: from the almost-beyond-belief multi-storey roadside slums, to the insane every-man-for-himself traffic, the incessant and completely unnecessary use of car horns (unnecessary because everyone is using their horn all the time, from all directions, so there is no useful information conveyed). From the incredible dilapidation of so much of the infrastructure, to some of the incredible sights: the Dhoby Ghaut laundry, the Ghandi museum, the Jain Temple and some truly incredible Victorian architecture.

4970,Springweed,4,"Not the most guest-friendly, but more than acceptable otherwise","I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. The hotel staff are extremely paranoid about security, maybe that's a good thing in today's times. The room was very good, as would be expected given the price that they charge for it. I had a first floor room which had a sit-out of sorts. Comfortable bed, really nice bathrooms, thoughtful placement of desk, mirrors, etc.  While I would rate the hotel high in terms of food quality and taste at the restaurants, there are certain things that the staff needs to be less stiff about. Tired that I was, and hungry, I went down for a bite. After 2-3 false starts in my search for some soothing soup and basic simplistic fare, one of the hostesses told me that none of the restaurants could seat me as I was wearing flip-flops.

As usual, the service was excellent and the guest rooms was all round tip top.   Food wise, have only got praise for the breakfast selection. The choice of Indian and International selection was excellent.  Had the opportunity to dine at Soma and China House. Both excellent restaurants and my colleagues certainly enjoyed the food at Soma. For me, the Peking Duck at China House is a must try."

4973,ajcramer,4,A trapped feeling with no value options,"This hotel is very nice.  The room is adequate, but the closet could use a few more hangers.  Or if I can't hang something perhaps a few more drawers would be helpful.  The shower is one of the best I have experienced.  Prices for the amenities are outlandish.  A buffet dinner and two glasses of wine came to $106 just for me.  A bowl of soup with wine for room service comes out to $50.  Not everyone is on an unlimited expense account - my client allotted me 35 euros per diem in Mumbai.  That would get me a hunk of bread perhaps at this hotel.  All the restaurant options are expensive.  And there is no convenience shop to just buy a snack and a soda.

Since my connection onward was in the morning, arranged to meet up a few friends at their China House restaurant.  Agreed, that it was almost closing time, but was allowed to order a few apertifs......(my friends were there since an hour and had almost finished dinner!).  Since their kitchen was closed, had requested them to bring a bowl of pasta from their All Day restaurant for my dinner which was bluntly refused.  No amount of pleading helped.  Although only for a night, I went to a neighbouring hotel to sleep as I refused to part with my money in a hotel that could not make a simple exception for a customer."

4977,Jubbin55,4,Huge and efficient hotel,Stayed at the hotel over night for a meeting in the hotel the next day. The hotel is huge and located near the airport in Mumbai. In rush hour it takes about 20-30 min to get to the hotel from the airport.  The check in is efficient and a little effort gets you to your room. The effort is essentially because the hotel is huge so you take time getting to your room.  The rooms are generic but smartly furnished with everything you expect in a five star hotel. All amenities that you expect from a hotel of this size is available including a platter of fruits and slippers. The toilet is great with both a tub and a separate shower area.    There is wifi but it at a cost. There is no view whatsoever in the  room so the automatic blinds are better kept closed. I ordered dinner in my room‚Ä¶

This hotel is very spacious, which is unusual in Mumbai. The lobby area is huge, and offers a lot of space for meetings and casual meet ups. You'd often find hundreds of ongoing business meetings in the coffee shop and lobby areas during the work week, so its not very private. The room was large, functional and quite modern.

While it has always been one of my favorites in Mumbai, this time was better as they have renovated some of their rooms, and I landed up in one of them. The rooms have been done nicely with contemporary woodwork and 42"" LCD screens. The staff was extremely courteous, with their maintenance team turning up at 1 in the night when i was trying to make the USB stick output on to the TV screen. While checking in, one of the staffers accompanied me all the way to my room, which again was good. The only minor glitch is their long isles.

Instead of receiving a luxurious treatment, it was more like"" if u r not happy, go somewhere else!"" Very poor club breakfast!  Very expensive hotel. Prefer regency hyatt and park hyatt to grand hyatt. "
4993,PATravelGal_11,5,Truly wonderful experience,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai on a 5-day business trip last week.  What an incredibly wonderful experience.  It is a large hotel, but several members of the staff greeted me by name.  They frequently asked if I was enjoying my stay and wanted to be sure I had everything I needed.  I thought this was because I was a woman traveling alone, but learned from male colleagues that they were treated the same way.  Apart from the staff being so accommodating, the rooms are very comfortable -- shower was wonderful!  If you wanted to watch TV, there were a variety of stations in several languages.    I ate at Soma, the Indian restaurant, and had an amazing meal.  Delicious food and received great help from the waiter and others on the staff in making my dinner selection.  The staff‚Ä¶"

4998,TravlAdvisor,4,Best Italian Restaurant,"Hotel is located very close to the Domestic Airport and away from the southern bombay area. Rooms are comforatble, but the best part about the restaurant is the italian restuarant celini. They serve really good pastas and risottos and the complimentry bread is really good too. Worth trying."
4999,Getabreak,5,"Quiet, comfortable and good food","I have stayed here a few times over the past 18 months, as well as trying hotels down-town.  Now decided that if on business for a few days, it is nice being near the airport for quick arrival and departure and to ensure there are no traffic delays.  Stayed on the executive floor where there is great service, the staff generous with drinks and good snacks.  The Italian restaurant is very good and a night club that livens up at midnight which is interesting for people watching.  Air con was good, rooms large and comfortable and slept really well.  Hyatt truly know how to manage a good hotel, even in a difficult location."
